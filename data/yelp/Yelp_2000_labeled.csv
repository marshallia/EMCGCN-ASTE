1900971,OOXZBUss-A58j0usM2hueQ,2.0,"We decided to give twisted tree another try for lunch. Unfortunately they took a giant step backwards in regards to food quality. Our server was very nice and very attentive and I felt bad that we had to make so many requests of her.

We got there before noon and for some reason they sat us next to a large table of ladies all of whom were speaking very loudly. On top of that, they put us under a speaker and the music was also very loud. Strange to have music that loud during lunchtime. I asked our server to please ask them to turn down the music. They eventually accommodated the request but the table next to us was still very loud. 

Now for the food issues. I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare but they told me that the patties come ""pre-pressed and the best we can do was medium."" I wasn't quite sure what that meant but once I saw my food I understood. My burger was essentially a very sloppy steak burger looking presentation. So the meet was very watery.

My wife's salad was an odd combination of chopped up lettuce and a couple of other greens. She asked for no chicken with the salad but they gave it to her anyway. Then the chicken had been on a very dirty grill so the char on the outside had an extremely strong bad smell. I actually thought our waiter had a body odor issue until I realized it was the meat. It took several minutes before we could flag down the waitress and ask her to take the horrible smelling chicken away. She even admitted it was really bad. 

We probably won't go back again.",NEG

There are always so many unique styles and decor items, someone can really go crazy in a store like this! 

The prices for certain items are often very reasonable, such as tiles of all shapes and colors. The furniture can rare from affordable to very expensive, but all seem to be good quality.

We got the Duck Fat Fries, Scallops and Pan Seared Salmon. It was also my second time trying oysters and I have to say this place does them right .The vinaigrette that came with them was delicious - I could have eaten a dozen and been satisfied.

Fries were ok, nothing special. The scallops themselves were delicious but they were served with watermelon (an odd choice). Salmon was delicious as well and the sauce that came with it was dreamy.

1813829,6DQH2JWVe6-c-IDNv-zd6g,3.0,"Everyone knows about Chinatown, just north of the heavily trafficked Old City district. But South Philadelphia's Little Vietnam remains largely untapped by the masses, and you can still find quick service in one of the many authentic Vietnamese restaurants even at peak hours on Fridays and Saturdays. 

Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup served with your choice of beef cuts or chicken. It comes in a towering bowl capable of satisfying most hungers, and shouldn't run you more than, say, six dollars anywhere in the city. The broth is bland on delivery, but each bowl is accompanied by a collection of sauces, as well as fresh lime and peppers. And spice fiends can add the famous Sriracha sauce to their heart's content.   

I used to live a block away from Pho Cafe Saigon, at 4248 Spruce Street, and so I came to Pho & Cafe Viet Huong with a sophisticated pho-palate and high expectations. Pho & Cafe Viet Huong delivered some of the most tender beef cuts I've ever had in a bowl of pho, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. (The noodles are what give the dish its texture and can make or break the meal, much like the rice in a New Orleans jambalaya.) Moreover, Viet Huong's beef balls -- not to be confused with Italian meatballs -- trumped, hands down, any beef ball I've had in Philly.   

The service wasn't bad, either, though not spectacular. A lot of pho joints will have a bowl at your table faster than you can get in and out of a McDonald's drive-through. This is not an exaggeration. At Cafe Viet Huong, however, I waited about ten minutes for my Ph Ti N&#7841;m B Vin (#35, with beef eye round, well-done flank, and beef balls). Like I said, not bad. Especially if you're planning to make a night of your Little Vietnam experience.

The real downside to Pho & Cafe Viet Huong is the interior of the restaurant. And, no, you don't usually go to a pho joint for ambiance; many of the finest Vietnamese establishments in the city are awkwardly laid-out holes in the wall. The thing is, Cafe Viet Huong masquerades its flaws. It looks -- and I don't think I'm going too far here -- like a really cheap Las Vegas buffet restaurant. Horrible art and neon lights adorn the walls, and the place, frankly, is just too big for its own good. You can BYOB at Cafe Viet Huong for a small fee, but if I were you, I'd eat my meal and then head out to a bar.

I'll close with a disclaimer for the novices. 

Pho, quite honestly, has a strong, unique smell. It's wonderful when you're eating it, but your boyfriend or girlfriend may not like it later on, when you're watching some old Meg Ryan movie and trying to make out. The fact is, the bowl is so big, it takes so long to eat. The flavors seep into your pores, your shirt collar. Look, I'm not trying to gross you out; it's just the truth. It's not just a matter of brushing your teeth, either; you'll need to take a shower before that big night on the town.",NEU
5626351,VIAmlcFEEozYw9dKhA5rHg,3.0,"I came here the day after New Years and it was packed! My boyfriend and I were craving some Vietnamese food knowingly that it wouldn't be as good as the Bay Area. 

Originally, he was craving for the traditional Pho, but ended up getting a rice plate with pork chop. I had my fave; Bun Thit Nuong. Although, it wasn't as good as the ones I had in Sac or Bay Area, it still left me feeling full. The meat was good, but overloaded with noodles. We also ordered imperial egg rolls which was also okay.  It was strange that it came with a side of noodles though. 

Service wasn't all that great either. No one really checked up on us after the order was taken. While we were eating, one of the workers were aimlessly stocking the chopsticks and spoon in our table. It was really rude because she didn't even notify us that she was going to do so.

From the bar before dinner, to our appetizers the service time was horrible. My lobster bisque was too salty to eat once it came.
We waited an hour and 40 mins before our entrees arrived.
I ordered the lobster tail, and not being a sushi fan, I always ask for my lobster to be cooked through.
My lobster was raw in the middle (see photo) and I lost my appetite upon seeing it.
My husband went a little crazy at this point and demanded to talk to the manager. The manager came over to the table and offered to show my lobster tail to the cook staff. I declined a new tail. I just wanted to get out of there.

Kevin knew his stuff and was very personable. We all liked his conversation, it wasn't forced and he recommended some nice wine for the table. 

Inside it was nicely decorated and the lighting was romantic, dimly lit but not so dark you can't see what you are eating. I ordered the New York Stripline with garlic mashed red-skinned potatoes and shared a few sides including asparagus tips and shaved parmesan and sautéed mushrooms and onion. The sides were tasty but the main event was epic. Even the mash was exceptional. I should have ordered peppercorn sauce because I love it. But the steak was juicy  so I didn't need it.

We came in with high expectations and left sorely disappointed. Came in around 9, 10 on a week night and it was dead empty. It was our first time here and we were confused. No hosts greeted us and no waiters or waitresses. There's a few guys at the bar and a girl talking to them. I searched the restaurant for someone to take us to our seats. Went as far as going into the kitchen to ask for assistance. We were redirected back into the empty dining hall and again nobody there. I went up to the bar to ask the customers how to get seats, only then the girl talking to them introduced herself as an employee of the pub. She's playing bartender/host/waitress by herself. Apparently not good at multitasking because we looked at her many times and she saw us scrambling around looking for people. To make things worst, she short changed our bill by 9 dollars at the end of the night service wise, this place gets a one. Now let's get to the bad parts.

We ordered a few items to try. The chicken pie has been hailed as the dish to get on Triple D and also the grilled octopus. We also got poutine fries. The fries came out first. Oh man was it salty! It tasted like someone pour an entire box of salt into the gravy and tried to cover it up by towering on a crap load of cheese. The fries were soggy under all that gravy, it tasted more like over salted french onion soup poured onto fries. The pie was another let down. The crust is decent but the filling was only lukewarm, like something you buy and heat up in the microwave. It was so dry I felt like I was eating shredded chicken, where was the gravy? The grilled octopus was the only redeeming item. The octopus is grilled perfectly and had a nice chew to it while still tender. Just when you thought they did it right, all the toasted bread under the octopus was burned. I mean burnt, not charred. The pricing was also ridiculous, 17 or something like that and it was an appetizer portion.

I would have given a one for the experience but they seem to have a really nice variety of beer. We didn't enjoy ourselves enough to get some but the girl did offer some samples for us.

The mac & cheese was good and cheesy. Simple & satisfying. The fried green tomatoes were a real winner with us. Thin sliced fresh green tomatoes covered in a tasty batter with a little crunch to it and the tomatoes after frying had a pleasant creamy texture. This dish was also served with a small bowl of southern style remoulade sauce (which I didn't see listed on the menu.) This sauce was so delicious that it was like another side dish in itself.

The flavor was spot on, but it was soaked in OIL. I mean a ton of oil. Just look at the photos. Also, there was an issue with the price...

I looked this place up on yelp and they had a yelp menu. In the menu it had six tacos for $9.99. I ordered two sets of six tacos and when I arrived the price was $11.99. So, I brought this to the ladies attention and she said..."" oh yeah, we need to change that."" So they are aware that people are expecting to pay less, and arrive to a larger check than anticipated. I really hope they change that soon.

So I really want this place to be the ""go-to"" for tacos. I will try the food again and see if I can get is 'sans' oil. If they can reduce that, I'm hooked. Also, I hope they change the prices listed on the yelp menu as feeding my large family had a substantial increase in what I had to pay.",NEU

Will BYOB is an intimate house-converted-to-restaurant establishment specializing in both authentic classical French cuisine and its modern accouterments. They offer a simple a la carte menu with a special prix fixe menu on Sundays that is four courses. 

We decided on the tasting menu. 

The meal began with a delicious Plowshare Farms Pumpkin Potage. Pumpernickel. Uni Creme, Onion Confiture. The uni creme is the edible part of the sea urchin and deliciously balances the sweetness of the pumpkin potage. 

Burgundian snails glazed with garlic butter in a country ham Dashi emulsion. Steamed cauliflower, truffle of spinach puree, oyster jus. Dashi refers to stock made from fish and kelp, used in Japanese cooking. Delicious to say the least, and I am not one to be into eating snails. However, that being considered, I cleared my plate rather quickly...in 1-2 minutes to be exact. 

Whole Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushroom, better known as the Japanese name maitake mushroom, which means ""dancing mushroom"". Ricotta, Madeira, Petite Herbs. Madeira is a fortified Portuguese wine made in the Madeira Islands. Served with some edible marigolds. The mushroom tastes fresh and delicious and not chewy like one would expect a mushroom to be. It was a delight to eat that while I started cautiously, it turned out to be one of the best dishes of the evening. 

The meal was interrupted before the main course with a lovely palate cleanser in the form of a mango sherbet. Delicious. 

Main course: Florida Cobia Sunchokes. Shishito Peppers. Matsutake Mushroom. Red Wine Bouillon. Very similar to tuna. A very diverse fish. Honey miso surrounds the fish. Miso is a fermented rice based sauce. It added just the flavor the dish needed. Again, another home run at Will BYOB. 

Dessert: Crème Fraiche Coffee Cake. Chocolate Cremeux, Greek Yogurt, Red Wine Caramel.",POS

The fancy donuts usually take the spotlight, what with their inventive flavor combinations, and rightly so.  The glazes that adorn these fried rings of batter typically reflect their stated flavors very well.  Banana Cream Pie and Sticky Bun that are currently in rotation could practically stand in for their namesakes.  

But 9 mornings out of 10 I'm walking out with a half dozen hot donuts, three plain (or old fashioned), three assorted of the sugar offerings and a small hot coffee.  Some like it hot, and also for the paper bag that carried the donuts home to be translucent leaning transparent as it sucked up some fry oil.  That isn't to say they're oily or greasy.  They're fluffy and moist and almost creamy all at the same time.  And warm.

However, I had an all day teacher seminar in downtown St. Pete at the Museum of History. I was pretty excited (not only because I'm a history geek, but because I've heard magical things about the culinary scene in downtown St. Pete). I used the ever reliable Yelp to help weed out the ""Meh's"" and democratically and methodically choose the best option. My colleagues and I decided on 9 Bangkok. 

We were seated quickly and our orders were taken pretty speedily as well. It was a hot August day and we all would have liked the a/c to have blasted us with a little more cold air, but it the temperature was moe than bearable. 

Our dishes arrived quickly and we dug in. Noting that not much conversation was spoken for the first few minutes, it was decided that the food here is pretty spot on. My ""thai spicy"" was just the right amount of spice for my spicy palate. I ordered the Basil beef which had various fresh stir fried veggies mixed in with a wonderful sauce and good rice.

It wasn't the best Thai food I've come across, but it was better than average. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the ridiculous cheap price. I ordered a water, and my lunch entree was served with a spring roll with a homemade sauce and soup. With tax, it rang up at a very generous $6.40! It works to the servers benefit (the price), as I had no problem leaving a 50% tip on such a cheap and delicious lunch. 

There's nothing better than getting a great meal at a cheap price. You feel like you ""beat the system"", so for that, thank you 9 Bangkok! :)",POS

This is the perfect use of open space. Urban parking lot turned urban park. There's gravel, grass and plants. There's also a super squishy foam ground in some spots that's paradise for your feet. There's also a variety of seats for people to chill.

The Friday night vibe was legit. There was a DJ spinning fun tunes: a variety of old school 80s jams through today's hits. It wasn't club music, at least when I was there; think fun sounds.

The big appeal for me was the food and drink. It's like an urban boardwalk. The best option if you aren't heading down the shore. The ratio of drinks to food may have been skewed; almost too many bars, even though the food options weren't lacking. 

There's empanadas, French toast bites, dim sum, tacos and maybe a little more. Spread bagels are there but close early. The bar variety had local craft brews, local wine and craft cocktails. Shout out to Urban Village who has their own pod; they definitely know their selection. I'd recommend the other drink pods brush up on their beer knowledge; thank goodness for Untappd. 

This place is also BYOD. The D stands for dogs! Cute pups galore!

I'd also recommend going up the stairs for the rooftop seats. It gives you a great view of the scene.

The bathrooms are even on point with a fancy trailer. I hope they maintain it and keep it clean.

Before receiving our bill I gave the waitress a coupon I had from the paper which was buy one entrée get one free. She told me she did not think we could use the coupon because they had brought my aunt a free birthday dessert, but she would check with the manager. The manager came over and was very rude. He immediately said no we could not use the coupon, that had been their policy for 23 years and if we did not like it we could email his regional manager. We had spent almost $200 so I thought he could have made an exception, but I understand that is their policy. However there was no reason to be so rude.

They added two more lap dance rooms, one is more private then the old open room that had  4 to 8 girls giving lap dances at one time.

The food is basically the same but sometimes quality is sacrificed here but to me thats the tradeoff for a place I can actually bring my child into.

No one ever showed up. I got up and asked another waitress if we had a wait staff she said whoops let me go find out what's going on for you guys. 
What a turnaround. 
A gentleman named Ty came over and informed us he would now be our waiter and boy was he great. He informed us that the server assigned to our section had been cut a little bit earlier and apparently nobody was assigned to our section. He apologized for the wait and then proceeded to make it a spectacular lunch for us. He even went as far as to comp a couple of appetizers for us and he even comped us a pitcher of sangria. Awesome. More than we expected by far. 

The food:
We have been here a few times before, so we knew what to expect. Nothing super spectacular, but nothing is bad. All of the grouper and the shrimp apparently are caught by local fisherman. Everything tasted fresh and was acceptable except for the processed french fries that I ordered as a side with my grouper fillet. Everyone in our party of nine seemed to enjoy their meals. Everything else was as expected.

Cons:
The french fries were processed and out of a bag, not homemade.

Pros:
My three-year-old twins were elated that they saw Dori AND Nemo in the fish tank by the front door.
Parking is easy with a huge lot across the street 
They have a huge patio if you want to sit outside.
Good beer list.

The parking on a Friday afternoon was plentiful and free and we got a spot just a short walk from the building. We enjoyed walking around the grounds and checking out the architectural detail for a bit before going inside. The first section when you enter has a fairly extensive photographic display about the centennial exposition where the Parthenon made its debut. I would have enjoyed spending more time on this section, but Larry S. wanted to get going. 

The rest of the downstairs is devoted to a small art exhibit. They have a nice permanent collection of American artists. There was also a great exhibit of paintings and photos of Tennessee parks. A painter and photographer each captured similar scenes in the same parks and their results were displayed side by side. It's a super cool idea and the art work was truly fabulous. I don't know if that is a permanent exhibit or not. 

When we were done with the downstairs, Larry S. said, ""well, is that it?"" I replied that I thought there was a 2nd floor, so up we went. When we got upstairs, the response from Larry S. was ""WOW!!!!"". The second floor is devoted to the replica of the Athena statue.

We asked for a quiet room and were located on the top (6th) floor after a super efficient and speedy check in at the front desk.

Breakfast is included at Hyatt place which featured scrambled eggs, sausage, mini muffins, cereal, toast, fruit, coffee and juice.  Just help yourself.

And, if you don't believe me, then you should believe Nicole Kidman who ranks Mas Tacos, Por Favor food truck as one of her Ten Favorite Things.

I have enjoyed Mas Tacos, Por Favor food truck on several occasions and I apparently was completely negligent at both checking-in and writing a review.  I deeply apologize for my tardiness.  Today, I had two cast-iron tacos on corn tortillas (because it's gluten free that way) and I had one carne molina taco and one quinoa/sweet potato taco.

The sweet potato and quinoa taco texture might be a little ""mushy"" for some people out there, but if you can get past the fact that your taco is more like eating a burrito (texture-wise) then you should be set.  The flavors blend together nicely and are accented well by the cilantro and red onion topping (along with a savory sauce of some sort that I wouldn't know without reading the menu again).

The carne molina taco is ground carne asada and molina cheese with cilantro (I think they keep the cilantro farms locally in business) and red onions.  Again, there is a nice sauce.  I would have liked for the carne asada to have been spicy - I don't know why but I feel like a taco with ground carne asada should be deliciously spicy.

I'm sure that if I had a family I'd be getting quite a few things here.  The really good thing about Costco is that the quality is good.  People tend to say Costco and Walmart in the same breath, but truth be told Walmart is cheap stuff for cheap while Costco is good stuff in bulk.  Case in point: Kashi is an organic cereal.  The fresh produce and meat is also of quite a decent quality

This particular branch of Costco is also useful since they refill barbecue cylinders.  It's also in the quieter area of the south end, yet close enough to Southgate for those who are looking to pile a few things together one Saturday.  The electronics sales, especially come Christmas, are pretty good here.  I've never bought anything from that department, but I've heard of great deals friends have taken advantage of.",POS

To start, the bread and ricotta was just as great as everyone here has said.  We all had the Turista menu and some fared better than others - they were out of the gnocchi and a main course because we were there so late, which was too bad.

1232252,YU68_vPyOb_J7CVYPPdcNQ,4.0,"Ahhhhhh.  The Pignic.  What can I say about the Pignic?  

Note that most of this review is in regards to my experiences watching live shows at the Venue.  I have never gone to the Pignic without a show being performed so I cannot speak to what a ""regular"" night is like.

It's not my favorite venue on the planet for live music.  The Picnic is basically a super old two-story house (although they don't allow access to the 2nd floor).  You walk into a living room which leads to what was probably a kitchen and small dining room at one point but has been converted to a tiny bar with two bathrooms. 

The bar area has maybe 10-15 bar stools at most and a corner table which seats quite a few people.  The rest is standing room only.  The living room area has two corner table - one which sits about 5 people and the other sits 4.  So if it's a good show you have a super small, intimate venue that would be great with about 20 people in it, but you have around 60 so it gets not only a tad to crowded but loud as well.

I have never been to the Pignic in the summer time so I cannot speak of the summer festivities, I hear they roast pigs on the porch and they have about about 10 BBQs lined up on the side of the building.  The outside ambiance here is pretty decent though even in the winter time.  A gas fire pit surrounded by benches helps keep you warm and cozy if you want to step outside for a bit.  You are not aloud to smoke up on the wooden deck which makes sense.

Watch your bar tab if you go.  At the end of the night we were charged for 2 more 805's than consumed and two mystery ""peach"" drinks ended up on our bill so we had to take it up with the bar tender who did remove them for us.   (The bar tenders were all very nice) I'm not saying it was intentional - it was a very busy night and quite possible that the wrong card was pulled for those items.

The place is very mid-town-esque and really not my bag unless I am watching live music so I don't think that I would frequent it on the regular however I can see how it would appeal very much to a certain demographic.

Upon calling in to get it corrected the host answered and was alarmed and shocked to hear this. He put us with the manager Cat, which is where this review stems from. Cat seemed to truly not care that our order was wrong, and frankly annoyed that this would mean more work for her. No apology, no sincerity for the situation. She asked what we wanted her to do about it, like ummm idk make it right?! So we told her at a minimum we wanted the impossible beginning to be redone. Her response was to ask if we would actually be willing to come back and pick it up. We said we would be happy to, because my fiancé still needs to eat. She said ok, gave us a timeframe and hung up. Upon arriving at Bru the host was understanding and knew instantly to check on the food. It was brought out by who I can only assume was Cat, who said very hastily thank you and walked away. Again no apology for the mix up, no offer to make it right, just a remade impossible burger. This may seem overly dramatic to some, but my fiancé was brought to tears over this, and no one can invalidate her feelings over this because they are hers to have. She is a true animal activists and lover of all life, and is vegan for ethical reasons, we both are. To have a manager like Cat who seemingly does not care whatsoever casts a dark shadow in Bru. We eat there so often, have been loyal customers for years, and Cunningham group reward members for over a year. We will go back, but this review had to be shared.

Edit: after our initial review, Bru and the Manager Kat reached out and truly righted the wrong we had with our order. It is reassuring to have a group that care for the restaurant business like this. They apologized and we accepted the apology. They were effective and quick with communication and left a strong pleasant impression on us. This is why we love Cunningham restaurant group and will be happy to dine there again in the future.",POS

While I have not been, I did get a chance to sample their food at the 4-Hands Brewery. I went up there with a group of friends Wednesday night after work. It wasn't overly busy for a Wednesday night, but I think the problem started when there was only one person manning the food window. The poor guy got overwhelmed at times and just could not handle the stress. That being said, that's one knock against them, the other knocks come from what I ordered and my friends sampled. I was in the mood for some mussels and when I saw that they had some, I couldn't help but order. 

The mussels were overcooked, they were dry, there was absolutely no natural juices and the shellfish themselves had a fishy odor which was off-putting.  I did like that you get a good amount in the bucket that you are served in, the toast is perfectly crispy and perfect for sopping up the broth in the bottom I just wish there was more of that as well. 

I got an order of the blue crab dip to share with the people at my table, with a companion pretzel although I wasn't sure what that was. It's kind of like a pretzel log but not that hard type, the more along the lines of the pretzel roll, and there's only one not much for sharing and neither is the size. It is most definitely not worth the money charged. There was no crab in there that I could tell, and there was a sweetness to it that was not what I was hoping for. Now maybe I got spoiled when I lived on the coast and got good seafood all the time. 

Their saving grace I believe would be the brisket nachos, the brisket is delicious on those. They're served on thick cut potato chips which were very nice and handled the toppings very well. First impressions are everything and Peacemaker did not make a good first impression.",NEG

6949592,gSAPoNsHLD-JZO5hD1KU6A,3.0,"Ok, I have flown a sh*t ton these last 10 years or so and here is my take on Spirit Airlines.

Yes the seats are not comfortable. lol They don't even upholster the backsides. This is a bare bones airline. Your fare pays for a seat on the plane. Anything else, and I do mean ANYTHING else, will cost you. 

That being said, all the people going off about hidden fees are flipping insane. They have a website (https://www.spirit.com/) where everything seems pretty clearly stated to me. It is not Spirit's fault that YOU did not do your research and ended up paying the inflated bag fees. Everything is right there in print. 

When I see that they are less than half the price of the second cheapest competitor the first thing I ask is... why?? If it's that cheap then there is always a catch. lol

Spirit is only good, IMO, for shorter trips where you only need limited luggage. I would say less than 4 hours tops and 2 to 3 days max. Otherwise just don't even try it. 

So it can be useful. 

Example: My most recent round trip (both direct flights) to MSY (New Orleans) from (LAS) Las Vegas. 

2nd closest competitor: $378
Spirit price: $151

We each took a backpack for a short 2 day trip. This qualifies as your 1 gloriously free ""personal item"". (Max dimensions 8"" X 18"" X 14"" and less than 40 pounds). Had what we needed for the 2 days and it didn't cost us an additional red cent. Want to get some souvenirs? Mail them to yourself. I do it all the time. lol

I know I was fortunate this go round with Spirit because both of our flights were on time, if a little shaky at end of both flights.

Flight Attendants were a bit cold and seemed generally unhappy, but I was never treated rudely. 

When you think of the money you are saving (which is why you're reading this) and you go in knowing the rules, Spirit can be a decent option sometimes. 

They're still better than United. I can't stand United. United blows. I would rather be strapped to a lawn chair onto the wing of a Spirit plane, than fly United Airlines again. 

Ok, rant over.

As for Spirit, I would honestly say 3 stars in the right situation. lol

We tried to order the breakfast bowl, but we were warned by the server that it would take 30 minutes, so we ordered omelets, hash browns and biscuits. Low and behold, the omelets took 30 minutes as well. When the server brought them out she apologized and informed us that the cook was on vacation . So who cooked our food? The dishwasher?? The omelets were OK. The biscuits were good. The hash browns weren't hash browns , They were like Home Fries, seemed to be yesterday's baked potatoes and were dry and unappealing.

Since I just moved to the St. Pete area, I found the studio searching the internet and picked up an artist from the pictures I saw on the portfolio. When arriving there with the picture of my planned tattoo printed in paper, they asked me to send it via email, which I did immedatelly. 
The first artist simply didn't want to make my tattoo ""because it was a cover-up"" of a previous one I have. Then he sent me to ""another artist of the studio"", who also asked me to send the same picture of the tattoo I had in mind (I showed him the printed picture beforehand). He agreed to do it and told me he'd send me emails to communicate with me about it, which I never received. Then, I paid the deposit for him and scheduled the next time to see the guy, for the drawings. Every time I called the studio to confirm he'd be there, he wasn't. So, today, after I called the studio again to confirm to see him, the receptionist just said the second guy also didn't want to make my tattoo and would refund my deposit. After weeks of him having agreed on doing it. We're talking about a simple tatto of a HOUSE. I didn't come up with anything offensive and I was really polite and patient the whole time.
The tattoo I'm planning to have is really simple and the only difference from the usual processes is that's a cover up. I really don't understand why they left me all this time waiting and without any sign of communication, since I even paid a deposit.
I might not have time to show the tattoo for my elderly relative due to the time I wasted with them. It seems like one of those shops that either you're a friend of them or a hot girl. Otherwise, they'll treat you like totally disposable.

Located on Earhart, next door to the Daiquiri place, It looks small and uninviting in an obnoxious red building. I step inside and I'm surprised! It's a cute sushi place! There's about seven booths and four or five tables maybe? Very small but cute. 
Our server had a great personality. The menu had pictures --- very enticing to a hungry crowd. None of the appetizers were special or different from your regular sushi joint. I went with my classmates and we ordered almost instantly based on pictures. We got Gyoza, Asuka Roll, Louisiana Roll, and the Saints GO go go roll. Gyoza was delish, you can't really go wrong there. The Saints go-go-go roll was fresh, delicious and perfectly sized
Unfortunately, our hungry eyes did not notice that Louisiana Roll and the Asuka roll are practically identical. The Louisiana Roll just had shrimp tempura and the Asuka does not. There's a $4 difference too... I would rather two Asuka rolls instead of paying extra for that shrimp - I could hardly tell it wasn't in the Asuka roll. I'm not used to eating fried rolls, but this roll was good! It had a good flavor combination with just the slightest hint of spice.

 on the 3rd and 2nd floors) ...apparently, for some reason, that other group's surprise birthday party was way more important and deserved way better treatment than ours ...strike number 3.

1st time (soon after it opened), the bartender talked our ears off while we looked at the menu and waited for our food--a little too much friendliness. When our food arrived, it was wrong. He'd entered one item twice and didn't enter the other item. We called it to their attention but declined to wait for them to cook the other item. We knew they were new and could see how eager they were to please us.

2nd time, pretty good meal. The only problem was my husband had trouble finding anything he liked other than a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. You can get burgers, tri-tip, chicken, and fish. No pork outside the ham and cheese sandwich.

3rd time, they didn't even have ham for a sandwich. He finally decided to order the tri-tip (sliced tri-tip with sauce and sides).

I thought the service sucked; my husband was more forgiving. When we told the server we needed a couple more minutes to look at the menu, she disappeared for 15-20 minutes. I asked to have a specific item left off my burger and it arrived with it anyway. The server has perfected the trick of walking by while our mouths are full asking, ""Is everything good?"" She never noticed the unwanted things I'd pulled off my burger and piled on my plate. Other than that, my burger was good.

My husband's main complaint was the steak knife was too dull to cut the tri-tip into bites.

A grand slam in a city of home runs (pats himself on the back for such a good analogy, even though baseball is a boring, horrible game, I say this not as an anti-jock hipster, because I love the NFL, anywho I digress).  Inexpensive to the point where you question the ingredients.  Then you take a bite, and it is fresh, delicious and satiating.  We ordered the chicken tacos and fish taco bowl (I don't think it's called that).  The chicken tacos were immaculate, but the fish was in a league of its own.  With two bottles of water, our order came to $17!  I think what I love about food trucks is that it forces a 'chef' (or whatever they're called) to make a very high quality product in order to thrive.  They don't have the ability to stock 14,000 various menu items (too much variety is a weakness in my opinion, as it waters down the quality as opposed to restaurants with a small menu, case in point, check out the encyclopedia known as an Applebee's menu)

This place gets the rare designation (along with Cochon Butcher) as being a place  I will always go back to when I come to New Orleans.  For those of your more ""touristy minded"" folks, make the short walk (it's half a mile from the French quarter) and check out this truck.

I can say that Ariano was a completely unexpected, yet completely wonderful experience, and I will be back soon to partake in some of their great options going forward.

Atmosphere - Welcome to a distressed Italian restaurant, with both outdoor upstairs dining and lower level, people watching dining. The gentle sounds of a live acoustic guitar and aroma of warm baked pizza crust fills the air. Two things stand out when you first walk in: The large, extremely delicious looking gelato case with house made gelato, and a cozy, but well stocked bar. Nice greeting from our waitress as we entered.

Waitstaff - Our waitress did a good job of bringing out food, and working with runners to make sure our water glasses did not run out. She also recommended some of the specials (more on that later), as well as gave some personal recommendations of entrees to eat during our meal.

Food - We happened to dine here on a Monday, which if you've never been, is known as 'Mexican Monday'. I was very confused because this is an Italian restaurant, but the waitress assured me that the head chef knew how to make this food well. We started with some chips/salsa, & guacamole. it's amazing that with another Mexican place across the street and a few blocks up on State, that this Italian restaurant has the best in Media. Chunky, and simple, my diners really enjoyed the flavor and texture. So we expanded, and went with a steak quesadilla, mahi-mahi tacos, and a pizza to boot. While the pizza was liked by my other diners, it was not a personal favorite. What I did enjoy very much was the consistency and flavor of the other dishes. Tacos were perfect. It's my standard order when I try a new place, and between the thick fish and quality sides, these were done right. Add on the great steak quesadilla, and it was an unexpected delicious surprise night.

Intangibles - Meal was not expensive at all. Dining for 3 before tip was less then $70! although we only had one diner get bar service. Right across the street from Media parking (which is free after 6pm) was nice for distance. They may move the gelato stand next door, as construction was going on what appears to be a smaller gelato shop so the restaurant can expand. We did not have any dessert on this meal, but will be back to try in the future.

Overall - Good on price, location, and flavor. Was pleasantly surprised with Ariano's Mexican food. I'll have to update my review in the future if we go again for pizza, but I'm sure a different pie would have a better result. Don't forget live music some nights as well, so a great spot to get to as we move into the new season. Just another reason to love living near Media to try all these good spots.",POS

We were the only table in the restaurant when we walked in, sadly. Service was spot on and we got our food literally less then ten minutes after ordering it. It was lightning fast and completely fresh. 

I ordered the lemon ricotta buckwheat pancakes, meanwhile fiancee got the goat cheese quiche. His piece of quiche had to be the biggest piece of quiche I have seen, if not the tallest. It was served with a generous portion of pear salad. When I see the word buckwheat, I assume that it will be dense mass of pancake. What I got where three delicious pancakes, light and fluffy, full of lemon flavor. They serve the cakes with an orange marmalade sauce. It was wonderful. We also got a side of bacon. A side of bacon at most breakfast places is usually two lame, wrinkly pieces, but they're doing the thick cut stuff here. Four pieces for $3 = not bad, not bad at all. I wonder why though the breakfast portions are significantly more generous than the dinner portions, but whatever. 

Also worth mentioning are the bloody marys. Fiancee is a fan and I am not. I tried his bloody mary and it just about made a believer out of me. The drink was boozy, spicy, and outstanding. They serve their coffee in a french press and it was most excellent. We left very full and satisfied. Check came to $29 w/out the tip. That's just about on par with Peg's or Squeeze In for a full breakfast. 

I think Granite Street will be entering our rotation of breakfast places, whenever we need a break from the gut-busting (yet delicious) plates at Peg's. Highly recommended for brunch.",POS

My server was attentive, checking on me just enough that I never felt ignored, but not so much that it felt intrusive.

And man, oh man, was it to my liking.  I started with the baked shrimp, which were phenomenal. I took my server's advice and dipped my bread in the excess garlic parmesan deliciousness that the shrimp were baked in. who needs butter for the bread with that ambrosia?
With so many steaks to choose from I asked my server to surprise me with her favorite, after telling her how I liked my steaks cooked.  Ditto with the side dish.  ""Just bring me your favorite,"" I said.  While I was eating the baked shrimp, the manager stopped by to ask if I had ordered the fried lobster tail to go with my steak.  I told him I hadn't.  I had already told him I was from out of town.  I guess he didn't want me to leave without having the full Chophouse experience because when my entrée came out (my service selected the Delmonico with the loaded baked potato) it came with the fried lobster tail, courtesy of the manager.

- I was surprised that I didn't enjoy the food much because all the reviews are so good.

My absolute favorite is the Flammenkuche. I initially tried it because it sounded German and I have an unexplainable mild obsession with German things.  
It has caramelized onions, bacon, gruyere, and a creme fraiche sauce (instead of tomato, +1). It's the only pizza I get now. 5/5 

I did try their BBQ chicken. While it's no flammenkuche, it was still pretty good and very saucy. 4/5.

Good times were had, including my annual Mardi Gras parties here.  However things began a steady decline in terms of service just prior to its abrupt sale and subsequent closure.

Fast-forward the tape to the late summer.  I learned that this new place called ""The Drink"" was taking over the former Montego Bay location.  Curious to check it out, I took a date there on a Sunday evening - the host asked us where we wanted to be seated, and we both requested out on the dock.  On the way outside, we were given a brief description of the new management's plan for the location.

What really impressed me about the experience was the prompt effort of the staff to go out of their way to accomodate the customers.  My date was allergic to dairy products, and almost all of the food items contained some kind of dairy.  When I mentioned this to the server (I believe his name was Travis), he said he would look into the situation.  A short time later, the chef came out and explained to my date about the changes he could make to help her out and offered some solutions.  Travis came back and checked with her to see if things were worked out.  So we decided to share some shishkabobs, which were as delicious as if they were cooked over a campfire.

The experience with this staff gave me the impression that we were not just doing business at a restaurant, but hanging out with great friends who just happened to work there.  It felt like we were free to have a casual conversation on a one-to-one level without being looked down upon as ""just customers"".  That is the mark of great service in my opinion.

1751180,7wplwMQWYTI9lxgFztfWmQ,5.0,"I have recently realized the importance of supporting local businesses. One of the first places I began frequenting to show my support was Telle Tire & Auto Service. I have been there four times now and couldn't be happier!

I have visited for replacing tires three times and getting my alignment changed once. They are fantastic about fitting your needs in at the last minute and I have always gotten in either the day I called or the next morning. Their mechanics are all well-versed in every aspect of car maintenance and you can tell.

The first time I went, I needed two new tires for my Mini. They had them ordered and ready to be attached within one day and I got a pretty great price. The second time I went in for a flat tire. They replaced it with a discount from the warranty (a pleasant surprise) and let me know that due to the worn treads on my fairly new tires that my alignment was most likely off. So I made an appointment and had that taken care of. The last time I visited was for another flat (bad luck, I know!) which was fixed promptly and with friendly service.

I know that there are places that are cheaper, but I would rather support a local business like Telle. And when it comes down to it, the price differences are less important when it comes to receiving the quality service you receive here.

Now, in my eyes, that's a pretty bold statement, especially in South County; there are some pretty difficult to burgers to beat around here, and, I've got to say, Rockfire Grill scores pretty high among the top burgers. 

I absolutely love the atmosphere: the chalk and brick walls, the reggae and Israel Kamakawiwo'ole playing in the back. I was discussing the menu with my buddy (good variety of both burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and flat breads) when the owner, who recognized my friend, struck up a conversation with us and introduced me to the menu, which was much appreciated. The owner is very friendly, and very personable, and even checked up on us midway through our meal. You can tell she wants to make sure her establishment leaves you satisfied by the time you walk out. 

My friend suggested I get the Texas Barbecue Cheeseburger, and I'm very glad I did. It's one thick burger, but it didn't leave me feeling like I overate by the end of lunch. It was just enough.

is the pizza really good? yea
is the pizza the best in the country, or even the city? no
is it crazy expensive? kind of
is this place worth the hype? debatable (my opinion is still TBD)
am i being a harsh critic because of the hype? possibly...

maybe we should do some pros and cons...
CONS
1. Parking or lack-thereof... definitely uber. i'm not saying Beddia opened to be a 'destination' restaurant, but the reviews have made them one and that's though when there are few parking options. Even on a Tuesday at 5pm we had to search a little.

2. Price. this is no cheap chicken @ $22-28/pie + $$ for extra toppings. The 'appetizers'/shareables are not offensive but the pies... well, that can be a tough pill to swallow depending on how much you are willing to spend.

3. Menu... is very, very small. shockingly small. I think another reviewer mentioned there were 9 items not including dessert. I can say with certainty there are 4 pies + their special of the day and one is just plain cheese (+ $ for toppings). I get that this place grew from a teeny, tiny shop but I left kind of wanting more... more options. also note, none of the pies come with meat... it can only be added, for extra $, of course!

PROS
1. Food... IS good but the question at hand is whether it's THAT good. There were 4 in my party and we ordered the chorizo (tasty but a little confused as to why you would just order a plate of sliced chorizo on it's own), the red cat cheese (also tasty. we ate a lot of it with the chorizo which was an OK pairing), and a slice of tomato pie (delicious). For pies, we were told we couldn't do half&half due to the nature of the way certain toppings cook (ok fine) so we opted for the #1 (cheese) with pepperoni and #2 (white). Not sure how often they change their white pizza but the one we had was, quite unexpectedly, superior to the pepperoni and included mozz, spinach & calabrian chilies plus the crust was far crispier and less greasy than the pep. One caveat on the food: why is everything so oily?! I felt like I was going to break out around my mouth after all the oil on everything.... yuck.

2. Drinks... extensive drink menu. Our server sold me on their sparking rosato so I only glanced but did notice it was a lengthy wine list. There were some beers and cocktails also. My husband had their old fashioned which he said was heavy on the vermouth but I can't comment. Heard a great rumor that they are only marking up their wines about 1.5x retail which is awesome! I think a lot of people would rather spend $ on food than drink so this makes sense... and maybe makes the $25 pizza bearable???? maybe??????

3. Service... was fine. No, it wasn't AMAZING but also, remember, this is pizza we're talking about, not white table cloths. Our server was attentive and thorough in her explanations of everything, very knowledgeable. She was happy to answer our questions and patient with us when we were undecided on what to order.  

Overall... honestly... I think you have to go to form your own opinion. There are going to be mixed review from LOVE to HATE and I'm somewhere in between. The food is, undoubtedly, very good but I don't see myself seeking out Beddia in the future- it's certainly fun for a random night with friends if you happen upon it but it is not a place worth the time it takes to stalk resy for a reservation. I'll save that effort for Royal Sushi.",NEU

We bought two very expensive and supposedly state-of-the-art fireplace inserts from the Hearth & Grill Shop last year, and we've had problems from the very beginning.  The problem is with the remote-controlled pilot lights.  THEY JUST DON'T WORK!

We placed several service calls during last winter, and each time they said they had it fixed.  Until the next time it didn't work.  It quit working at the end of the winter, so I decided to let it go until this fall, since it would still be under warranty.

In October, I disassembled the log set and cleaned them, blew out all the lines, and replaced all the batteries.  It wouldn't light, so I called for service.  The service adviser suggested I look up some Youtube videos on fireplace maintenance.  He finally scheduled a service call that was several weeks out.  The technician verified that neither fireplace was lighting correctly, so he lit them with a lighter.  
He promised to get new parts and return in two weeks,  He didn't.  
I called the store, and they promised to check into it and call me back.  They didn't.

The hosts were nice and there was ample seating. Drink options included an abundance of nationally distributed and local brews. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It is not a traditional Cuban and to call it a Cuban is really a disservice to that great sandwich. This version of a Cuban was ok. The pork was slightly smoky and moist. The ham was there but overpowered. The cheddar cheese and BBQ was were alright but don't really belong in the Cuban. The bread was described as a baguette, but don't think crusty. The baguette was soft and more like a long brioche bun. Kids had chicken nuggets and a burger, both of which looked like not much effort was put into. The fries were the best part of each plate of food. None of the food was bad, just ok. The kitchen is open to the dining area and you can watch as the staff cook.

The chips are made in-house and are literally addicting, and their salsa, although medium heat, is extremely good. 

We started with the Elote. Tender, sweet corn on the cob with chipotle aioli, queso fresco and green onions, we could've ordered another one it was so good, but we had yet to try many other offerings, so we started choosing....

Roasted Cauliflower with salsa macha and peanuts. I've had cauliflower appetizers at a number of restaurants recently, and Penca's is one of the best I've had. The difference being it wasn't deep-fried, and the salsa macha gave it an ever-so-perfect flavor. 

The Agua Chile de Callo is a raw scallop dish with chicharron dust, avocado, cucumber, and onion - set atop a squid ink sauce that changed my mind about squid ink forever! Oh my - this was heavenly. Not salty, fishy or overpowering in any way. I am now a forever fan of squid ink.

The highlight of our meal was the Pulpo - braised and grilled octopus, habanero salsa, avocado, radish, hierba de conejo black beans, pea tendrils, and Spanish chorizo. I don't have any other words than sheer delight. Don't skip any of the dishes mentioned here. They all shine.",POS

This is a dark maze with little to no light.  There are a couple of tea lights to highlight clues you need to find within the maze, but be prepared to be feeling out in front of you for walls, halls and doorways.  
No one will grab or touch you, but there will be loud noises and characters running around.  Someone is watching your group (you are the only group during your session), more to assist you if you get lost or need to leave.  The whole experience was great, but be prepared to be scared and have your heart racing.  If you do not enjoy haunted houses this may not be your thing, but it was more of a scary experience/atmosphere than being frightened by actors jumping out at you.  There is an actual escape room located within the middle of the dark maze.
Since you have the option to leave the session at anytime and nothing really scary happens why not try it.  You will be surprised how much fun you will have,",POS

My sister and I went in on a Sunday night to grab nachos and a drink at the bar. This was the first time my sister had been to the restaurant and just stopped by to visit me and grab a snack. 

Food and drinks aside, we were verbally and physically violated by a drunk patron. The bartender continued to serve this guy drinks while he continued to harass my sister and I. We are African-American and this man went on a racist rant about his ""White Privilege"" while the bartender and manager did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to stop him. The other patrons also just watched, which is whatever. But after my sister and I asked for him to stop bothering us, he only became more disrespectful. We asked for the check and the bartender was either in shock or oblivious because he just stood there. He even gave the guy another beer. After aggressively asking for the check and telling the guy to get out of our face, we finally left. 

I came in later to make a complaint and all I got was a ""we're really sorry that happened"". I will never go back to Taqueria Feliz, which is unfortunate.

This  store has an excellent selection, but given demands during Covid, supplies are often sold out quickly. That is not the store's fault, but a sign of the times. Staff is helpful, but if you need serious design help either see one of the designers at the front, come at a non- busy time or get your own designer. People who need handholding ought to hire their own designer before they come in. If you are browsing, either expect to be doing the work yourself or have help from a designer or installer.   A lot of the complaints about the store seem to reflect a customer need for handholding without a true understanding that this store is essentially the Home Depot of tile and floor stores. It's a big box with lots of inventory, and if you know what you are looking for it is a great resource. If you expect swanky service, go hire your own designer and and let them do the heavy lifting for you.


The above notwithstanding, there e-commerce site is substandard, and inventories listed on the site do not necessarily reflect what is in the store. That does not make them unique however, as many retailers have this problem.  

Some of these reviews are unfair and do not reflect the reviewers' understanding of what the store is about.  Again, if you want swanky service this is the wrong store.

So my complaint after many phone calls and
Visits to the store:  Staff are helpful, but if you call they are only helpful if they  answer the phone. On one call to this store I was on hold for a very long time and a person from the hardwood floors department finally answered and worked really hard to help me when I had a question about ceramic tile, which was not his department.  While I greatly appreciated his effort to solve my problem, a better process for handling customer calls when first received would be greatly appreciated.  My one serious complaint about this store (Other than the E-commerce site being substandard) is that phone calls are not answered promptly, and if a call is actually answered the caller is placed on hold for a very long time, which is extremely frustrating.  My experience is not one call, as this is happened numerous times. Obviously an area for improvement for management.""Hello floor and decor can I place you on hold"" is not sufficient. Someone needs to actually talk to the customer when they call... or if they are placed on hold someone needs to monitor that fact and make sure that the customer is not stuck waiting for a very long period of time for someone to actually release them from hold and talk to them.",NEU

purchases. Been coming to ME for the past 5 years to build and upgrade new gaming systems and this experience set me off.

Ive recently purchased a sizeable amount of hardware totaling just over $3000, one item of which was a $100 motherboard for a new system. This motherboard had a processor installed by their technicians. I found that the pins on the CPU socket were bent when switching out the processor into a more desirable motherboard and brought it in for a refund. Customer service was non existent as it felt as I was immediately identified as at fault for the damage. Manager Peter was only concerned with his bottom line stating that they would take a ""hit"" because nobody wants to buy a refurbished board and that there was nothing they could do outside of returning the board to the manufacturer. Even in the event that the board was fixed they would not definitely state that I would be able to have it returned. He even mentioned I could spend $50 to fix it then get a partial refund, are you serious? Peter even had the audacity to mention that the reviewed footage shows the tech didn't do anything out of the ordinary which is absurd. Unless there is a camera directly above the workstation, zoomed in, and in amazing quality there would be no definitive way to determine if the cpu socket pins were bent or not during the mounting process. Give me a break, I've seen their released pictures from their system of people who steal from them and the quality isn't even close.

I regret purchasing a 2080 TI ( and the rest of the components) from Memory Express and if it weren't for their shady final sale policy on these cards I'd return it. I'll be dismantling my new build and returning everything else that I purchased from them. The disrespect was unwarranted.

Most of the crowds around those places seem to cater towards your more sorority and fraternity party zones. Now generally I am not one to frequent and party at those places, just because that's is not really my type of scene.

Morgan Street Brewery though is kind of the exception down there on the landing. Whenever I walk in there I do not feel as though I have become some floating particle of bad cologne. No, at Morgan Street there is just about every kind of person there. That is what makes Morgan Street a fun place to go.

The wide range of people there also brings a variety of other things. The most notable of the difference is the music. Not all the music is the same bump bump bump bump and grind. No, you have music from all types of genres. That would be the main reason I enjoy going there. One moment I might be dancing to David Bowie's ""China Girl"" and then next moment I might be dancing to M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes.""

Morgan Street also has a number of bars too. Downstairs or rather, through the front door of the place they have a rather large bar where the restaurant seating is. Then upstairs there is another bar. Then also, when you pass outside through their garden thing, there is another bar. So, that being said, even though Morgan Street is a very popular place and is usually rather crowded, a drink is easily served.

Once we were all seated, the waiter promptly placed a basket of their house fresh crusty baked bread on the table with a bowl of some fantastic whipped butter on the side.

First off, the seafood risotto was mind-blowingly good. The portion size was just perfect with enough to save for a nice treat for lunch the next day. There was also a generous amount of seafood with delicious morsels of fresh prawns, clams, langostinos, mussels, and bay scallops throughout the dish. The Arborio rice was cooked to tender near al dente perfection in a creamy white wine pepper sauce. I need to learn how to make this dish at home next. 

The roasted mushroom pizza was next and is good enough for two hungry people. It is topped with fresh spinach, button mushrooms, portabella mushrooms, porcini mushrooms, pesto, and fontina. The crust was very tasty and had a good amount of chew to it. Although this was also a solid choice, the clear winner of the night was the seafood risotto.

Just once I would like to order my food without seeing  bare thumb in my plate or bowl. I started to get the bowls to avoid them sticking their thumb in it like they did the plates but it's even worse. Each time I go I have to tell them to take their thumb out of my bowl! I don't understand why the employees don't notice that it isn't sanitary and they don't even realize their doing it. But they work in the food industry. They should be more conscious of what they are doing when handling food. It's not just one employee, all of them do it. I watch them do the same with other customers. The customers don't even say anything or not noticing. I also watched an employee with a ton of hair on his arm reach over food to clean the counter. Thank God what I wanted was in another location of the counter. Please make your employees wear gloves before a customer gets sick.

When we arrived we were the first people in the building for a low key Sunday morning But the bar soon filled with regulars as sporting events started to come on their many televisions.

Food options range from a reasonable $7-13. my dining companions where satisfied with the their crab cake sandwich; and Crossbar burger with caramelized onions, swiss cheese, and applewood smoked bacon.

The battered-but-spotlessly-clean aesthetic is complemented by service that's friendly and often lightning-fast.  Menu is pretty standard short-order diner fare, with a few Southwest touches (if you're weird and like organ meat like I do, the chicken liver omelette is a must-try).  Tasty (if not particularly healthy) food, nice folks, and dirt cheap to boot.  Well worth visiting.

To finish with an amusing anecdote:  The bathroom used to look much like the rest of the place (battered, with exposed pipes and not much decor, but scrupulously clean).  The last time I went, I guess they'd renovated a bit - it's been redone in the style I like to call Early Aughts Yuppie - warm-colored walls, fancy raised sink, granite countertop.

Right in the heart of center city (so easy to get to). Beautiful interior. I felt more fashionable the instant I entered. Clusters of 30-somethings hung out by the stylish bar, all clad in upscale clothing- looking especially classy with their martinis in hand. We were led to our table, which was surrounded by a roomy couch and plush chairs. (The only down-side was that the table was so large that I felt like I had to yell to communicate with my friend on the other side.) 

So, comfortably sitting at our table, our waitress came over quickly and got us started with some delicious drinks. The rest of our meal ran smoothly, courses coming quickly and prepared delicately. I got the bacon-wrapped scallops. They were so juicy! I also got the seared tuna, prepared perfectly. I tried the Chilean Seabass, too, and that was one of the best dishes I've had in my life. The desserts were also great-- delicately prepared like the rest of the courses, and a nice, light way to finish the meal. (I got the brownie, but it was still quite light.) 

All in all, my 2 recommendations: 
-Come in groups so you can try lots of different foods (they're all good!)
-Come during restaurant week (otherwise I would never be able to afford this place) and still be prepared for the high prices. (But if you're prepared to spend, come! It's worth the hole in your wallet afterwards...)",POS

The drinks were nothing special and a bit too sweet, and the service was a little sluggish (even though there were barely 2 other tables), but the vibe was fun. And so, we decided to return for dinner one day - our mistake.

The food was poor. Have plenty of water ready before you try anything as dry as their pork tenderloin or chicken. The pork bounces when dropped from more than 3 inches high - as someone who has regularly worked with this protein, this was quite unsettling.

The Plato De Embutidos (assorted sausages) was okay, but greasy and heavy. That being said, they still tasted like they were removed from a package and reheated in a microwave, as did most of the food I've had there.

The legends about the poor service are true! Our waitress was friendly the few times she was attentive, but even friendlier to her friends at the bar and the pass. We had to flag down for service on menus and several more times just for water.

Got the shrimp Arnaud as the appetizer since it's their signature dish. It's a cold shrimp cocktail in a spicy tangy mustardy sauce.

The salad was a pretty typical Caesar like salad. The radish garnish didn't do much for flavor but the pistachios did.

Got the eggs adrienne which is an eggs Benedict but with a sausage and creole sauce. The sausage was good. Also tried a bite of the crab cheesecake which was like a cheesy quiche. The omelette was nice and fluffy but didn't taste as much of the truffle or other flavors, pretty typical but again nicely made.

I think I'd like to try the pork tenderloin next time.

Got the bread pudding with bourbon sauce as a dessert and it was great. Tried a bite of the bananas foster and it was amazing. Tableside service show too. Friends got the creme brulee and were upset it was cold (for something that should be torched?). She asked for it to get torched again and it came back still lukewarm. That feels mediocre for the creme brulee to not be freshly torched given the amount of flames they have here.

Warning this place does take a while. They believe in elongating and enjoying the meal. It took 2 hours for the first two courses. Even with that dining philosophy, it felt like service was a little off. Hard to get waters refilled.

4821252,LdWrLCUqeyIjqNxLy-6uFA,5.0,"I felt a little sad as the 737 lifted off the runway.  I'd visited the French Quarter for just a few days and found myself wanting to stay longer, much longer.  This place gets into your soul.  It really does.  There's a wonderfully rich co-mingling of French, Spanish and Afro-Caribbean cultures that make New Orleans much more of a Caribbean city than an American one.  You will hear it in the way people speak, see it in their buildings and taste it in their food.  You will find that the locals are genuinely friendly and they possess a pleasant laid back vibe that you would do well to emulate while you're there.

Now for some, the French Quarter equals Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street and loud late night drunken partying.  It is that and it's a lot of fun to be sure but then again I prefer to explore the other streets with their cool little restaurants and laid back bars.  There's also some great shopping with some intriguing antique stores, jewelry shops and art galleries, especially along Royal Street.  The French Quarter is a gold mine of photo opportunities with block after block of quaint French and Spanish style homes and buildings.  It's a wonderful place to put on your most comfortable shoes and explore the history lined sidewalks.  Some might opt to take a carriage ride tour or a guided walking tour to learn more about this fascinating place.

The mix of cultures also shows in the local cuisine.  Seafood, Cajun and Creole foods are all options for breakfast, lunch or dinner and for those with a sweet tooth, beignets and pralines are easy to find.  In any case, there's an abundance of restaurants, bars and pastry shops sprinkled throughout the area.  When it comes to food, the competition for your dollars is pretty stiff so you can be assured that you're getting the best at a reasonable price.  Also, don't forget to take the NOLA Hurricane Challenge and find for yourself the absolute best version of NOLA's number one boozy drink for yourself.

You can't talk about the French Quarter without talking about the music.  It's in the clubs, on the street corners and even in the streets themselves.   The French Quarter's street musicians are everywhere and they play real music, no Auto-Tune or lip synching there.  They add an energy that makes this place come alive as their voices and instruments resonate throughout the neighborhood from breakfast to dinner.  Whatever you do, make sure you stop, listen and show some appreciation for what these folks add to the experience of being there.  

The French Quarter is a dynamic and stimulating place to experience.  I'm thankful that I took a seasoned friend's advice to visit this place.

They were very understanding of our concerns. They quickly examined and tested Ellie. In the end, Ellie did not have parvo.

Overall, the staff was very friendly, punctual and accommodating. They are also one of the few vets in the area that are open on weekends. My one qualm is their prices seem a little steep. I'll stick with my current vet and use Klaich in the event that they can't get me in.",POS

The place was pretty dead, yet the host tried to seat us at a table with crumbs and obvious food and drink stains...the table had been bussed but not wiped down.  

We asked instead for the clean booth next to it...and were sat there.

Waitress comes over.  She looked tired.  I immediately hoped we weren't sat in her closed station.

Her greeting non greeting reinforced her desire to not be there.  But OK.

Asked if the margarita were made with fresh lime juice.  Waitress said no.  It's a mix thing they have....a pre mix.

I asked if the bartender was any good and if she could ask if he could  make me one from scratch with a particular higher end tequila.

Answer.  I WILL NOT ASK HIM.  I AM NOT GOING TO PISS HIM OFF I HAVE TO TIP SHARE WITH HIM.

Ok.  Confirmed. She had her mind on leaving not us.

I asked again and off she goes with her cloud of negativity.  She comes back and says he said he will make me a ""short"" (whatever that is) but he doesn't have time to sit there and squeeze a bunch of lime wedges.

In my mind....what restaurant near the Mexican border doesn't have fresh lime juice....what quality bar....doesn't have fresh lime juice....and the kicker...the last time I checked.  LIME WEDGES COME FROM WHOLE LIMES....cut a lime in half and squeeze....did I mention the place was pretty dead.

We had ice tea and waters.  Ordered salads and left as fast as we could.

Back in Tampa.  Ended up at a BJ two days ago.  Sat at the bar.  Order a margarita...asked can you make it with fresh lime juice?  Bartender chuckled.  All of our drinks are made with fresh squeezed juices.

You receive several courses that get spread out over 4 hours, in which you need to arrive at 7pm and ends at 11pm.  One thing to keep in mind is that it's BYOB.  In the process of leading up to attending, they will send you the menu and wine recommendations to help you pair you drink of choice with the food they will be serving.

First up were the appetizers we were light, tasty and left us wanting to see what was coming next...
Next we were escorted back in the kitchen to meet the chef's and were seated to watch them prepare the food.  
With each passing meal, we started to discuss what we liked, what have we had in the past compared to this and what was coming next.
All the meals were prepared, plated and tasted great.  To dissect the menu would be a little much due to the amount of food that we ate although I will post it to show what we tasted.

We all left there stuffed and looked forward to walking to our vehicles so we can walk off some of the calories we just consumed.
The price of the meal is a little high for most people but if you want to experience something new, something fresh it's a great place to go...

It once had some decent servers who seemed to be hamstrung by a slow kitchen, but now the server staff has gone downhill and the overall experience is not pleasant. Others must agree, because it's gotten to the point where the last few times I have tried to go, either the bar or the main seating area was closed, or both. They were doing take-out only on NEW YEAR'S EVE and lost tons of potential revenue. I presume this is because of a lack of servers and bartenders, which would not be surprising given that no one is going to make good tips at a restaurant that people have stopped going to.

The menu is very unique to other places in the area, and the wait time is shorter too. For a party of 3 at prime brunch-time, we waited about 20 minutes, most of which was spent inside the flower shop next door. 

The place is very small, but decorated well. I liked the honest openness of the host. He seemed physically pained every time a new party arrived and he had to tell them that there were no tables available and they had to wait. After reading many reviews, I decided on a latte (delicious!) and I split both the foul moudamas and the chorizo benny. My boyfriend's mom got the quiche, which had great presentation. My main complaint is that a few of the flavors were weird. The veggies that come with the quiche are reminiscent of those frozen veggie variety packs at the grocery store, which isn't that appetizing. The chorizo was also not what I was expecting, but still good. The portions are very hearty, which is great.

For the simple ingredients (hummus, beans, bread, eggs...), the prices are a bit steep. There are tons of good brunches around that cost a bit less, so this place probably won't become a regular spot. The mini hot sauce on the table was cute, but ended up just being sriracha, and you have to ask for ketchup, which is then given to you in little disposable packets. I suppose that makes it more European, but it also creates more waste... 

We left with a few macarons to-go, which was a great treat for later in the afternoon. They were way too beautiful to pass up! They didn't taste super fresh, but I will chalk that up to them sitting in the car for a few hours. Overall, it's definitely a spot to try if you love brunch.",POS

Beer Can Chicken Sandwich = Really good. It comes with this sweet slaw, and I usually abhor slaw, but grab some of that slaw, and throw it on the sandwich. Without the slaw, it is still good. With the slaw, its unearthly.

Caramel Strawberry Desert = It was also on the specials menu, but my god it was amazing. Caramel + Strawberries + Mint + Sea Salt. OMGOMGOMG

It reminds me of the great places in Chinatown in NYC, except this place does not do true reflexology.  You can get an hour long foot massage (which includes some body work as well) for $30.  The massage therapists work diligently and do their best to respond to feedback.

My tips for getting good service here:

-Schedule an appointment
-Figure out which therapist you like, as they have different styles and there is not a ton of consistency.  I personally recommend Mike as my favorite.
-Don't be stingy with the tip!  You are getting a great massage for $30.  Tip more than 20%.  My understanding is that the massage therapists don't get paid much hourly and largely rely on tips.  This is not ideal.  I wish they were paid more fairly.  But it's so easy to tip $10 for an hour of work when you only had to fork over $30 for the massage.

Like I said above, Sugarfire does things a little differently. Instead of cooking out of a small shack they embrace a large downtown location by making it bright and loud, with lots of neon and decorations.

Once you're inside you will wait in line cafeteria style which gives you plenty of time to look at the menu, which features a number of creative and adventurous sandwiches, and think about what you want to order. Then you go through, meat / sandwiches first and then your choice of sides. I decided to try the special of the day, which was a riff on the Big Muddy. It included brisket, pork, BBQ sauce, horseradish and some other random ingredients all smashed between a standard bun. It. Was. Amazing. I paired it with a side of beans and glass of the restaurant's home made cherry soda (Sugarfire doesn't serve normal soda. They produce their own.) 

One small note, I dined during the latter part of the lunch rush and while it was busy, the staff got me through the line fairly quickly. The tables, from my experience, turned over enough that you should be able to find seating. I didn't have any issues.

Called back the next day, was told they didn't know anything so I'd have to call back later. Called back later, asked for a manager or supervisor, was told none work the weekend, call Monday. I asked about the fact that no managers work weekends, got back ""my phones are ringing, sorry"" I asked again for a manager or how I could get a hold of one and got hung up on.

The hummus here was amazing! I've experimented with hummus before and never developed a liking to it.  But, that all changed once I had The Vine's hummus.  Served with warm and fluffy pita bread (you can tell it's baked daily) it's seriously worth every penny.  We gobbled it up quickly while waiting for our entrees.  A 2nd basket of bread cost extra, but that was worth the expense as well.  We're obvious bread lovers.

Our table ordered the Lebanese-Style Hamburger, Sujok, Falafel Sandwich, Chicken Shawarma entree, and an order of fries.  Those with the burger and sujok raved about their dishes.  The falafel was good, but I felt the hummus was almost better.  Maybe I'm just not a falafel fan.  The one who ordered the chicken shawarma felt it didn't live up to her expectations.  She stated it was something completely different on her trip to Europe.  Not sure what she was expecting, but she barely touched it.  Another person at the table tried it and liked it.  The fries were good.  They were slightly soggy, but the spice was really nice.

The service was good.  Sometimes it was a little slower than we were used to, but overall it wasn't bad.  The atmosphere was outstanding.  It was cozy but not crowded, and the overall feel made it feel like you were actually in the Mediterranean.  I would return just for that hummus, mmmm.",POS

The tables and chairs for our event that Boardroom supplied did not arrive until after the start time of the event. Guests arrived and we were kind of stuck in the corner of the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention for drinks, since we paid for a 3 hour open bar. It took a really long time to order drinks at the bar, while we were waiting on tables and chairs to be set up in the private area we were supposed to have. About 15 minutes after the start time of the event, we were allowed to go into the space we paid for because the tables were finally there. 

There was a tour and tasting for another group going on in that same room during the first half hour of the event, which I was not aware of until I arrived to set up for our event. That should have been something that was told to me ahead of time. 

The communication between event planners and managers is lacking. I was told our group would have a tour and tasting at some point during the 3 hour event with the price I paid. I told the people who were coming to the event that too, so that is what everyone expected. When I got there, the tasting room manager said that if we wanted that it would be extra, and they couldn't do it anyway because they were really busy and it wasn't on their calendar. 

They had one person taking drink orders for our group of 25. That person had to run back and forth from the bar to the private area, taking about 5-7 orders at a time. It took a long time for drinks to arrive, he really could have used more help. It would have made sense to have a little bar area in the room we were actually in, so he could have made drinks there, without running back and forth from room to room. It also would have made sense since it was a set menu for the open bar, just to have pre-made pitchers of drinks ready of the different options, to save time.",NEG

He found her wallet on the floor near his shop.  This gentleman used very resourceful strategies to find my daughter. The wallet didn't have any cash left but he called all the phone numbers he could find including her bank, who called her and happiness was restored.   My daughter was thrilled to get back her remaining items, especially her UCLA ID.  She offered to pay for shipping and offered a reward, but Mr. Flamm graciously declined form of any payment.  Mr. Flamm mailed the wallet via UPS and included a Prestigious recyclable bag, a heartfelt note AND CASH FROM HIS POCKET to remind her that ""the life is still good.""  My daughter works 2 jobs to stay in school and losing her money was a considerable setback.  Somehow this negative experience became a very positive experience because of how Mr. Flamm handled the situation.  If you are a perspective customer, rest assured.

The Jambalaya was excellent, with deep, rich and full Cajun flavors which can only be obtained over time through a slow and steady technique.  Reminiscent of authentic Creole cuisine.  Well done.  The rice was slightly under-cooked which detracted slightly from the overall experience of the dish, but I was able to easily get past this and enjoy the the dish.

The shrimp basket was a miss, possibly because of a miss between what I was hoping it would be and what it turned out to be.  The shrimp were tiny pre-frozen, pre-battered popcorn shrimp as one might find on the kids menu, and tasted about as much.

Cinder was one of those places I followed closely prior to its opening (yes, even from Prague). Sours and ciders as the main focus for the bar? Sold, sold, and more sold. Extra sold knowing they were associated with the operators of Bru, U-Bahn, and Uptown Beer Garden. So much love to those spots.

My first visit was the day after I got off my transatlantic flight. Jet lag? Pfft. No match for Cinder! JK I left without drinking much because I started falling asleep at the table. But still, the bar made a lasting impression and now has become one of the go-to bars among my friend group when we're in Center City. And luckily for me, it's right off the PATCO line. Woo-hoo! Perfect location all around.

Only qualms:
- It can get pricy and hard to stay on budget, as you can expect by all the rare/fancy suds on tap.
- It can get seriously claustrophobic depending on the crowd. Cider Bowl last month? I lasted for about 10 minutes before hightailing it back to Bru's Sour Bowl.
- It can get loud. Very loud.

two important events took place the last week of may 2010: the tv series LOST aired its final episode....and a group of yelpers gathered together for a UYE in collingswood, nj. ok, so maybe not of equal importance, but both garnered a fair amount of chatter and debate on the yelp boards, to those who may recall. i organized this event under the pretense that ""no one is buying our reviews....so we'll tell it like we taste it, and hopefully we likey :)"" here's how it went:

as most reviews have mentioned, quite possibly the highlight of any meal at el sitio is the complimentary chimichurri mushrooms they place on the table along with the bread basket. i would take these shrooms over butter or oil any day - delicious flavor, perfect consistency, nom nom nom. best of all, as our table of eight kept plowing through them, the servers kept bringing out more.

most of the table ordered a few apps for the sharin, but i got my own order of plantain empanadas being that ""weird"" vegetarian and all. the menu description is a bit misleading as the plantain is the wrapper, not the filling, which is actually cheese. disappointment gave way to satisfaction after a few tasty bites, dipped into the accompanying sauce.

with no vegetarian entrees** on the menu, i opted for a soup & a salad, thinking the salad alone wouldn't be enough - boy, was i wrong! a heaping mound of greens topped with fresh berries, dried berries, citrus slices & grapes with a berry vinaigrette on the side was set down in front of me, and about half of this tropical salad came home with me. i did, however, finish every last drop of the house made soup du jour.

**insert gripe: no veg entrees? really? some of the sauces and seasonings on my dining companions' meats would work equally well on a piece of tofu, seitan, portobello or even eggplant. something to think about.... end gripe**

finally, our table was treated (thank you!) to a sampling of desserts, each one better than the next, and all house made as well. my favorites were the lemon pie and the cheesecake....oh, the cheesecake! i believe all eight forks were fighting over that one.

so the consensus? i likey'd. enough to go back? yes, but i'm not exactly rushing to cross the bridge for it, especially as a vegetarian. but to all you meat-eating south jerseyans: go here.",POS

You are handed an empty wine glass upon walking in the door which you can use to go up to different wineries or distilleries and try their products.  I have to say out of all of the different ones I tried St. Mayhem was probably my favorite.  The flavors of their craft wines were fantastic.  It was layered with flavor and very well balanced.  And best of all it came in a can.  Which at first I wasn't sure I wanted to try but I am very glad I did.  It was fantastic.  Bently Heritage Distillery was also a definite must try.  They brought their vodka and their gin.  Both are made with the ingredients from their property.  Everything is sourced onsite.  The flavors of both the vodka and gin were very distinct.  I am not a gin fan at all and I actually really enjoyed the gin.  It wasn't overpowering, it was well balanced and didn't burn going down.
At this event you were not wanting for food.  There was plenty of different vendors from Mari Chuy's, Bibo Freddo, Gas Lamp and, the different casinos.  All of the food was great.  The gelato from Bibo was so tasty and light.  It wasn't heavy like some ice cream can be.  The ceviche and the tostada from Mari Chuy's tasted fantastic.

From being seated right away, to the staff constantly making sure the whole dining experience was taken care of (cleaning down the table between courses, asking when the next course should be served, water glass always full, full explanations of the courses), and the food arriving promptly... dinner was fantastic to the say the least. 

For a party of two, we initially thought the tasting menu (which was recommended), would be a good option, but then opted to select our own choices ( the cheaper way to go, and also the food is extremely filling). The salatim (salad selection) and the Tehina Hummus right away were extremely filling- and that's coming from a daughter who loves to eat, and her father who can eat for three. The laffa bread is a must have(comes with the hummus), and two rounds are extremely necessary if you love carbs as much as I do (cheat day!!).

We skipped the mezze because we were so full and ordered the chicken shishlik and branzino for dinner! The Tzatziki spread tasted amazing under the branzino and the chicken was charred to perfection. Make sure to order the hummus or Salatim because the main course is only about three ounces which is why they recommend the tasting menu.

After all this food, we thought we could chow down some desserts but decided the only thing we could scarf down was the Malabi Custard - a perfect palate cleanser and dinner ending (:

4652267,lH-SY6ob6Wuo0oecvIE2xw,5.0,"After six years of being involved with Yelp, a few things are probably obvious. 

I'm an introvert. I'm casual. I'm friendly. I eat out most every meal, but I also very seldom do what we would refer to as ""fine dining."" 

So, you had to know something was up when I found myself at Nesso, a Cunningham Restaurant Group establishment inside The Alexander Hotel in the Pogue's Run area of Indy in this small but growing area of central Indy known as CityWay. 

The hotel is a boutique hotel and you get that vibe as soon as you pull up. Parking in this area is always a little tricky, but there's private lots along with limited street parking. I actually spied two accessible parking spots on South Street right next to the hotel and adjacent to Nesso. There was a curb cut only a few feet away. I didn't have any trouble getting out of or back into my car. While the parking is generally paid around here, the odds are pretty decent that if you're going to Nesso that's not your first concern. 

I attended a special VIP dinner the night before the Indy Shorts International Film Festival kicks off here in Indy. If you're familiar with dining, then you know Executive Chef Kawika Pieper and Executive Pastry Chef Hattie McDaniel - you also know that means you're in for a culinary delight. 

Our reservation was for 8pm and we knew we'd be staying until they are scheduled to close at 10pm (during the week). We had a rather lengthy table set off to the side of one of their areas. They offer outdoor dining options and have a beautiful dining room that is perfectly situated for both social and intimate situations. 

As we were a rather large party, we had multiple servers. I couldn't begin to tell you who was the actual lead, because everyone worked together as a team so nicely. After allowing time for initial introductions and socialization, the four course evening began. It was nicely paced throughout and involved one round of two appetizers (multiple servings placed along the table), another round of breads, the main course (4 options - I chose an absolutely incredible pollo dish), and a dessert option that was, again, also placed along the table so that you could try both the ice cream option and the tiramisu. 

The atmosphere is wonderful - it's got an electric vibe, but it never gets overwhelming. The CityWay area is a bit higher-end - I joked about not being nearly hipster enough, but you actually have a nice weaving together of different age groups and some ethnic diversity that's nice. Our group included age, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and ability diversity yet I don't think anyone ever felt out of place and the crew here at Nesso was impeccable with everyone. 

The food was remarkable from beginning to end. The bread options were, perhaps, a bit lighter than I'd have chosen but I can't fault a single aspect of the meal and the main course was simply stunning. I'm not usually a fan of tiramisu, but this tiramisu was mind-boggling. Yes, mind-boggling. 

As is frequently stated in reviews, the service here is really the highlight. I got very few names, because the service truly doesn't aim for ""notice me."" It aims for ""enjoy your time with us."" There's a huge difference and it's on full display here. Wine glasses were filled in timely manners, special requests/allergies were addressed discreetly and respectfully, water glasses were always filled - even after they'd closed. We never felt rushed out the door. Every single server was incredible. You can tell they live into a culture of service here. 

In short, while I may have started off feeling a bit out of place here I was quickly immersed in this wonderful atmosphere. It was a bit of an urban escape, a terrific meal with terrific service and an overall experience that you truly remember. While there's no question this is fine dining, it's the kind of fine dining that's worth it and a fantastic option for those seeking a special, memorable dining experience.",POS

I especially enjoy that the front room is simply a dive bar perfect for enjoying a few drinks before the show starts. For this reason, I do often arrive right when doors open to grab a seat here. 

In the back in the venue part, I appreciate the floor being multiple levels. As a shorter person, I try to grab a spot on the first step up so I can see over most people's heads. There's also a bar in the back of the venue that moves pretty fast even with show crowds.

I do find that voices carry in this space so a chit-chatty crowd can be distracting. Also the women's room only has 2 stalls so the line can get long... but that's better than just 1 stall!

Although the menu looks creative and beyond delicious, it's of no use if your food comes out cold or you actually have to go searching for your wait staff .  We dined for breakfast and also outside on the front porch of the hotel on two separate occasions over the weekend.

It was obvious on both occasions that the wait staff was doing their absolute best, but truly couldn't keep up with the amount of people they were expected to wait on.

In the beautiful dining room, my cappuccino came out WITHOUT coffee; My husband finally had to track someone down to replace it. Over half of the breakfasts served to us were cold, but by the time we got them we were starving AND no one came back to ask us how our meals actually were.

Our outside dining was abysmal, also. It took 15 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive... another 15 more for a side salad to be delivered.

My suggestion - stay at the Vinoy, the hotel and its staff are fantastic. EAT and DRINK ELSEWHERE. Try The Hollander Hotel down the street (www.hollanderhotel.com). Although not as inventive a menu as the Vinoy, your food comes out hot, delicious, and the staff couldn't do more for you.

The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. Modern is the feel I got from it once I entered. Pretty fixtures, cozy lighting, and very clean. The restrooms also were nice sized, clean and well stocked (as I had to take my daughter in for a quick diaper change. Oh yes, it is kid friendly as well.)

Our server, Aaricka, was amazing and such a friendly person. She recommended several items for us to start with, including the sticky brussel sprouts (made with apple bacon caramel, smoked almonds, and crushed red pepper) and the Blackberry Bees Knees (Aviation, Local Honey, Lemonade, Blackberries). Both were wonderful, and the flavors complimented each other.

For my entree, I tried the fried chicken and waffles (served with hot honey butter, bourbon maple syrup, and pepper jack cheese on the chicken).

I decided to order the shrimp feast, one friend ordered chicken over the Greek salad and the other, lamb over Caesar. We also shared the tzatziki with soft pita wedges and my two friends also ordered the lemon chicken rice soup. 

The tzatziki and soups were served first. Warm pita wedges were fresh and great, tzatziki ok, I've had better/tastier. My friends did enjoy their soups and commented the lemon was very present. One Friend was surprised by they type of rice that was in her soup which appeared to be basmati rice.

Our entrees arrived shortly. I very much enjoyed my shrimp feast which included a green salad, rice (or roasted potatoes and I chose rice) and a fair portion of shrimp, the friend with the chicken over Greek said she as happy and the friend with the lamb would have preferred the lamb a little more rare but said it was tender.

Not knowing much about this restaurant, it appears to be possibly a franchise or chain and I thought it was good but not the best I've had. My bill was around $22 which included a $2 tip, a bottled water and the tzatziki starter. Not bad but also not fast food pricing.

Pre-Party: The owner can be slightly stubborn on any additional ideas on how you want your party to be. It was very challenging to get her to alter what she kept saying we don't do it like that. Examples, seating arrangements, Mimosa set up, and setup time. Let's start with the seating. We had a party of 24 people. There were a total of 8 tables in the room. The owner wanted to squeeze us all to 3 tables on one side of the room. Now, this is a Bridal Tea party that we paid for the space. It took two people separately to try to get her to change the seating. The Bride had to get involved and try to convince the owner to use more tables for the guest. Finally, it was agreed to used 5 tables for guest, which left two round tables and 1 rectangle table. We used the long table for games/prizes. 1 round table for cupcake display and 1 table for champagne flutes. Second, the mimosa bar, the Bride wanted a table to be a full mimosa bar, so I purchased decanters, chalkboard, fruit bowls, and etc to be told that we had to come with our mimosas premixed and we had to use their two juice dispensers. The Bride wanted 4 flavors, basically, we wanted a variety and for guest to be able to make thier own fresh mimosa. The owner kept saying that's how people do it and that's how we do it. It took some convincing to be able to do it the way the Bride wanted. It was very frustrating purchasing things and paying for a venue to have a personalized party just to be faced with challenges. Also, party started at 1pm. We were only allow to start setting up at 12:30pm. 30mins....How frustrating!! Now lets talk about post party. The party was awesome. The setup was beautiful. The food was great and fresh. The servers were awesome, friendly, and very helpful. The owner was not there so I can't fairly say if day of event would she have been more accommodating without any challenges. Overall, the event was a success. I would recommend having your event there. I would just recommend asking all your questions concerning the details and the ideas you have for your special event. It can be a little annoying and frustrating 2 weeks prior to be told no you can't do it like that.

However, as much as I value customer service it does not surpass my expectation for quality work, especially when I'm still paying for my car. After getting hit by an underinsured driver, I called my dealership (Larry H Miller Jeep) and they said they work with this place for repairs, etc. I looked it up and didn't look further after seeing all the great reviews. I worked with Rich and Todd and both were wonderful, throughout. When I picked up my vehicle (the first time), I immediately noticed the finish of the grill was too glossy. I took it home and after further inspection, I also realized the bumper and fender didn't align where they met. I called my insurance guy and he said no problem, he would talk to the guys at the shop and get me back in. They ordered some new parts and I took my car back in once they got them. Mind you, I'm a full time student, work approximately 30 hours a week, and go to an internship 16 hours a week. In addition, my grandmother's health took a turn during this time and she was in Phoenix, so, I had to wait to go see her. They guys got the job done in about 3 days. It was pouring when I arrived to pick it up so I ran in, got my keys, and left. At this point, I just felt like I really NEEDED my car to get around. The grill and fender now align better, but unfortunately, although the finish on the grill is more matte, the color is now too light. Maybe not noticeable to others, but I notice it and that's all that matters. It doesn't look horrible, but it just doesn't look like my car did before. To be reasonable, I can imagine what a difficult task it must be to match the right color and finish, but it can't be impossible. I feel like they really tried, but I feel disappointed that after the second time, they still couldn't get it right. At this point, I absolutely can not afford to not have my car so I'm just going to leave it as it is. On a side note, I went to get an oil change with the dealership after the second time and some of the service men did mention the color of the grill looked a little ""off""and they told me that they had recently stopped working with Thoroughbred Paint and Body and gave me a business card to a new shop they're working with.",NEU

My husband and I have been eating at Asahi since it resided on the corner of Harding Pike and Harding Place. I do miss the hole in the wall location a bit but the newer location is more spacious. Luke and his wife are lovely people and we like supporting a locally owned family business. 

When reading the bad reviews I kept thinking people are confusing Asahi with a different Japanese restaurant because we've never encountered the problems others are describing. First and foremost, the sushi is always fresh! In all the years eating there we've never had any fish that seemed even slightly ""off"" as one person described. While we order rolls we mostly choose Nigiri where it's imperative it is fresh because you can't camouflage the taste with the ingredients you might find in a roll. We eat Salmon, Tuna, Yellow Tail Octopus etc. There are a variety of rolls with choices that have grown over the years and we each have our favorites. My current favorite is the Music City roll and of course the California roll. The ingredients in each roll are on the menu so no surprises there. 

We've also both had Chicken and Shrimp teriyaki and enjoyed both. It's never dry and always flavorful. The beer is always cold.

People have mentioned that you don't see many customers, however it all depends on the day and time. What many don't realize is Asahi also has a huge take out business! Our orders are split between take out and eat in but we have Asahi at least once a week.

We've eaten at other Sushi restaurants around town but Asahi is hands down our favorite. It's laid back and family friendly and easy to spot a neighbor or two.

4597369,iBrmOi7XcAVGs74W9GiWyA,3.0,"A few days before coming here I got a sandwich at the Art Museum location. Craving another, I made an order at this location for delivery. I used the online ordering feature through the Yelp app, which was quick and painless. The app comes with a nifty little tracker that shows the progress from ordering to delivery. It took about 15 minutes from the time I placed the order  for the tracking app to show that the delivery guy left the store with my order. 

Since, I'm just down the street (translation: four city blocks) from this place, I put on my shoes and stepped outside at 10 minutes after the guy leaves the store. Please explain to me why I'm still standing at the front door 35 minutes after the guy leaves the store, waiting for him to arrive?? 

I guess the guy senses me asking this question because he then calls me to say that he's on 46th street. I ask him if he's lost, because it shouldn't take him 30 minutes to drive one block from the store. He informs me that he just left the store and would be at my place in 5 minutes--the same amount of time it would take to drive to my house directly from the store, in normal 4pm traffic.

He arrives and proceeds to give me a lecture about how he's not late because he just left the store. Further, he tells me that I have no evidence that he's late unless I spoke to someone at the store (his tone and condescension...such a perfect setup). So, I pull out my handy tracker, which documented the supposed time he left the store with a timestamp (no evidence my ass; thanks Dominoes!). His new explanation? That he had to stop to fill up on gas, then he had to stop to take care of some other car issues (all in the four blocks between the store and my house), but that the tracker is inaccurate and I shouldn't pay attention to the time it gives. (Me: Riiiiiight). A minute ago I had no evidence, but now you've got more excuses than pregnant nun! 

Verdict: the food was really good, perfectly seasoned, perfectly baked, all portions were accounted for, and no skimped ingredients this time. Even better, the ingredients actually tasted fresh. Unfortunately, if I have to get delivery, I am highly unlikely to order here again. My advice is to (1) order online to avoid any confusions with getting the items you want; (2) pickup the order to avoid the ridiculously extended wait times (and lies) to have your order delivered; and (3) pick up on foot because any expectation you may have of finding parking in this area is seriously mistaken!",NEU

While my dad was working on one car that was completely out of commission with a fortune in parts (and some good will from my dad on the labor), we were down to one car for a two-working-parents family. 

So of course, the Universe being what it is, our other car goes out.

I'm no mechanic, but if you know your way around a spark plug even a little, you know when your alternator is going out. I had the battery tested, and it was fine, and on my way back home the radio goes out, then the car dies completely as I pull into my driveway.

I call around to see who can do the job, quickly and without jacking me around on price. I called Jack Furriers, their mechanic was in (it was Monday), and they had the alternator in stock. The friendly and straightforward man working the front (I can't remember his name and it's bugging me since he deserves to be recognized. I'll try to remember and come back to update) stated part and labor would be about $350, and they could have it ready in a few hours.

I dropped it off, with a request they first double check to see if it was indeed the alternator (nothing worse than paying to fix the wrong thing). It was, and I left it there to be repaired.

As promised, it was done in a few hours. As promised, the cost was about $375 (the repair plus tax).

The duck taco is by far my favorite.. it comes on a special thick taco shell, almost like a latke, and you only get one of them instead of two for $8. I don't see this taco on the website, so can't provide more details, but it's on the specials menu of tacos in the store. 

The BBQ spiced cauliflower tacos were a bit disappointing they need more spicy flavor. Bar Bombon has better cauliflower tacos. However I do really like the smoked pork pastor tacos at Revolution taco. The Mahi mahi tacos (seafood special) is OK. I prefer the Mahi tacos at Buena Onda. I also prefer how Buena Onda lets you mix and match tacos, Revolution does NOT.

As a newcomer to Bella Prana, I signed for the special: $39 for 30 days. I tried out various instructors and classes: Beginner, Power Flow 2, Gentle Yoga and Hot 26.
Pluses to this studio:
A lot of classes and variety to choose from (I travel a ton so my schedule is erratic)
Very large studios 
Clean, spa-like atmosphere 
Non pretentious 
Fantastic instructor. Every class I tried, the instructors guided each move, providing imagery to ensure maximum potential is achieved; and, clear direction for modifications.

My favorite class by far is Hot 26. Classic Bikram with Very warm (above 100-degrees) temperatures (if you're feeling tight and need time to come into your own, this class is it), and a strong intended focus to each and every one of the 26 poses.

Pre-face: I came here for a birthday party, we were nine in total.  I will essentially give the rundown on my evening here. 

My biggest issue is that it took 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks. They actually came after our appetizers came out.  The server said the bar was slammed because of recently lifted regulation in standing area, but at an establishment where the drinks are $15 I expect them quicker.  The gin drink I got was good.  

Food.  We ordered the smoked mahi dip spread.  I found these portions to be small and to be honest lack luster.  For our mains we ordered the sausage trio and my girlfriend ordered the pappardelle.  They were out of the chef's cut, which I found frustrating since the only other beef option was the tomahawk for $100. 

The pappardelle was delicious.  For the price I would  recommend this dish. The sausage trio was average at best.  I wouldn't order that again.  I also tried the potato/Gruyere side dish, it needed to be eaten with a spoon which I found unpleasant.  It was actually more souplike.

Recently I decided to go to a work happy hour. I generally stay away from these as I prefer to keep the after hours Noah separate from the corporate Noah as one is a respectable, hard worker with a lot of upside and the other has been cut off more that Bubs from The Wire (props to those that know the reference).

So going into the happy hour I was a bit on edge to begin with but I've been to the Continental a lot so I felt that being on home turf would be an advantage. Unfortunately the roof was closed for an event so we went down to the second floor bar. We had about 9 or 10 people and were the only ones there. 

The bartender started off fine, everyone got drinks and was talking. I ordered a vodka club and gave a generous tip to ensure smooth service the rest of the evening.  Wellll, another group came in that he must have known and and that was basically the end of our service. 

A friend of mine was waiting for about ten minutes for a drink while the bartender was talking to another patron and I heard the patron say to him ""I think those guys need drinks"" and he said they can wait. Now I don't know if there is a back story and someone in our group splashed this dude with a puddle on the way in but he had some sort of beef with our group.

As I was starting to get angry I decided I'd save my dignity and leave but before I did I thought I'd see if I can get his attention and order a drink for a friend (since I think I have amazing report with everyone) when we made eye contact I said, ""she needs a drink when you have a second sir"" he responded I KNOW.

The fries are pretty good too, hot and crispy, and I love the Cajun seasoning on them. The only issue I had was that they doused the fries in so much Cajun seasoning that it was so salty to the point of inedibility.

It did not enhance our meal in any way.  The food was very good.  We got almost no information or suggestions from our waitress, so we luckily made good choices.  At the end of the meal, I was presented with the check in a typical check folder that had the American Express logo.  When I put down my American Express card, I was told they only accept cash.  I had a party of 7 and did not have enough cash.  It was pretty embarrassing since I was hosting the dinner.  My son had to run a couple doors down to a cash station.  I told the gentleman (I'm not sure if he was the manager or a waiter) that they need to warn people about the cash-only policy.  He said they always do.  Well, I called for my reservation and they did not tell me.  I thought hard about this and can't remember ever being in a cash only restaurant.  Very strange.

So, bottom line, would I go back?  No.  The food was very good, but there are lots of great restaurants in Philly.  I would rather go somewhere that will treat me with friendly service and appreciates my business.  Also, since I don't usually carry lots of cash with me, I think I'll take a pass.

A ton of space is also given to book-types that tend to soak up those forgotten tables at the library book sale like Travel, Oversized Coffee Table Books, and Pop History. That stuff sadly came off as wasted space to me.

Despite going through the entire store a few times I was unable to find a single book I wanted. If you're interested in scifi or fantasy I don't recommend this place.

4720408,RzWjJvfjfmJ_NEcR2XVMDQ,1.0,"I couldn't wait to get back to my hotel room to write this review.  First of all there is a dog in here owned by one of the stylists, a french bull dog named Wilbur who sits on your lap and is unleashed.  Yesterday I spoke to a receptionist and told her I only want a fun cotton candy pink, lavender and cotton candy blue look.  The receptionist was so upbeat and said yes they had all those fun colors.  I walked in with my therapy dog.  I have epileptic attacks and she comforts me.  The salon was just not cleanly but I walked in without any judgment and since my stylist was not yet ready I walked my dog outside and came back in.  I told her I wanted half my hair cotton candy blue and the other side soft pink.  They talked me out of what I wanted and she proceeded to ask me if I wanted a new cut.  I said that was NOT what I wanted since I am trying to let my short layers grow out.  She then used a fromesi bleach of 30 volume and stuck me under a hair dryer.  She lied to me and said she would only leave the bleach on under the dryer for 10 minutes.  My hair is already dry and very curly so now my hair is stiff since she neglected to use a deep conditioning product on me.  There are parts of my hairline she left out.  I have brown hair sticking around the edges and under my neck there are golden rings.  Honestly I paid for this?  I asked for pink and blue and she went through the FARCE of using pink with her brush all over scattered in my hair and the only place that held color was my bangs.  She used too high of a bleach and was in such a hurry to get me out the of my salon chair that she did not allow the bleach to process long enough.  I could have spend $80 in Chicago to have much better service yet they charged me $150 and all the pink and blue was washed out of my hair completely since she used really hot water on my tender scalp then used shampoo!  Who uses shampoo after coloring your hair?  Everything here was ridiculous from the dog that is all over you and in your face unleashed and able to roam free to the kids that marched  up the stairs that scared my dog.  I would never never recommend this dive place to anyone.  The owner was really nasty to me.  I was so hurt when she screamed at my dog.  These kids ran up the stairs to the salon and of course my dog is going to bark so the stylist yelled at my dog to shut up. Imagine an unclean salon,  people who don't know how to achieve the look you want and expect you to just take their suggestions and bullying attitude.  They have big attitudes here and I never asked for a dime of my money back but now I wish I had.  I had some blue here in my luggage that I used in my hair but this is not the service I expected.  I f you want fashion forward looks don't go here.  Most of the clientele here were middle aged woman who don't expect much. If you are fussy like me and progressive thinking with fun ideas they won't listen to you nor will they know how to work with color.  Who sticks someone under a dryer for a full 20 minutes with bleach at 30 volume?  They are careless and truly not savvy.  At the end of my services one of the stylists said to me the following :  ""I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU!""  Um you mean nice people who get ripped off and treated like dog shit?
At the end of the day you want to feel good about a new color or style I just felt awful and in two weeks someone from another salon is going to have to undo their mistakes.  My hairline is still brown so she obviously is CARE LESS.  I hate going into a salon where no one listens and the stylist is sloppy with the bleach process.  My dog did not deserve to be yelled at and I should have insisted on a full refund but I am sharing this information on line instead with people who do care about their hair.

As he brought associate veterinarians onboard we had the benefit of many dedicated and knowledgeable professionals who helped our furry family members enjoy healthy, comfortable lives. 

These days I take my dogs to VCA Swengel to see Dr. Villanueva. My dogs love him. He's a fantastic clinician and particularly adept at caring for dogs of advanced age. He's also remarkably patient with all of my questions about bloodwork data and differential diagnoses. 

The vet techs here are great - often they answer all of my questions before I see the doctor. The heroic administrative team are warm, efficient, and smart. In the last 3 years I've had a handful of urgent/acute dog health issues and they've always worked me into their schedule despite lacking an appointment. 

Some of the aspects of this veterinary practice that I appreciate involve what doesn't happen at VCA Swengel. For example, I've never felt up-sold. They haven't dismissed my concerns or rushed my appointments. I'm never surprised by unexpected billing items because they show me costs in advance. They've never missed a diagnosis. And their conservative approach to treatment keeps expenses low and saves patients unnecessary interventions.

Nothing is perfect but after 30+ years of experience with this clinic I recommend them to anyone looking for a great vet in Indianapolis. They've been there for me and my family through good, healthy times and bad, terminally ill times.

I've been to Thomas' many times and always enjoyed the food and the service... that is until a few weeks ago. My friend & I most often share our meals... we looked over the menu and then waited for the server to tell us what the specials were.... Butter fish he said... hmmm. butter fish.. never heard of that... the server tells us it is a little darker, slightly stronger flavor.... so we thought... that sounds good... why not.. lets try it. The fish came out... it was a little darker kind like tuna and it was thick... tasted ok... We finished our meal and went home. Not long afterwards, my stomach became upset. My girlfriend on the other hand, had much more severe symptoms. I called her the next day & she asked if I was having stomach issues after eating the butter fish... I said that I did experience some discomfort but seemed to have weathered it. She was still not ok. She felt nauseous. This went on for almost 3 days! She kept pointing to the butter fish but I wasn't convinced since her symptoms sounded more like a virus. So she did a google search and low & behold...butter fish contains some oils that a human being cannot digest & process and the oils act as a laxative. Nice...huh! Apparently, butter fish used to not be legal to sell but somehow that has changed. Why would a chef put this on the menu knowing that it can cause gastrointestinal distress in most people! I told a friend of mine and he has a rule of thumb... if you never heard of it, don't eat it.

Unlimited Total Body Enhancement - How does the Red light therapy at planet fitness works?
The red light therapy at planet fitness works in a simple way and the procedures typically involve the following;

The Red light therapy device is placed on the body of the patient (especially in places where fats are very difficult to burn, these include the waist, belly, and thigh),
The device is operated at the required level of Red light for between 5-20 minutes at a time.
The device stimulates the production of more collage, through vibration effects in the body and this will speed up the rate at which fats are used up.
The patient use the device on another part of the body as dim necessary by the instructor.
Daily usage will result in a long term weight loss over a period of time.

When the waitress brought the food, I noticed that my veal had no cooked batter on it, but it appeared to be fresh white seasoned bread crumbs, and they weren't even browned. However, the veal itself was warm and thoroughly cooked, and was reasonably tasty.  When the waitress finally came around to check on us, I asked her why my veal was not either deep fried or pan fried to give the bread crumbs a light crisp. She said the chef doesn't fry anything, but everything on the menu is baked, except for the calamari appetizer. So those of us who had ordered Eggplant Parm, Chicken Parm, or the Veal, had baked meat with bread crumbs that had not browned.  For me, this was somewhat of a disappointment. I informed the waitress that if I had known, I would have ordered something else. She didn't offer any options. So if there are any fried food lovers reading this, please make note.

I don't actually live anywhere near Philly BUT every time I visit I make sure to get at least one of their bikeshop bagels and a Kelp Smoothie. They're so inventive with their tastes and ideas. While not every single one is a perfect hit in my taste buds (one time i got a peanut butter chocolate thing and it was OK... Not my taste... Possibly the Nudge) nothing can make me hate them because of the amazing prize-winners they make (bikeshop bagel and kelp smoothie obviously). 

I guess I'm to assume the reviewers who wrote about poor service and them running out of items came in on bad days? Or at the wrong time of the day (the busiest or latest)? The people who work there are ALWAYS so sincere and interesting and willing to talk to me. Only once have i wished my food would come out faster (my only tiff) and that was because I couldn't wait to bite into that amazing bagel. 

For the punk part. I don't consider it punk. I think it's trying to go for the starry natural indie look more. If you want to call that punk, be my guest, but German punk is what my head goes to when you say that, and leather jackets and 80's crazy hair and piercings. The Satellite doesn't strike me as being that. They're more music scene, appealing to the people that like it. If you don't like the way it looks, get with it, or go to Starbucks or something. The local experience is here and if that's not what you're looking for, don't go.

The bar when you walk in is tiny, but there is a dining room as well as an upstairs bar and separate living room lounge area.

We were told by the host that we could stand around or go to the bar while we waited for the other half of our party to arrive.  This was fine because we planned on being early and having a couple drinks prior to our friends arriving.  The host told us once that our party arrived we would be seated right away.  The other half of our party arrived at 8:11 so we expected to be seated quickly within the next couple minutes, but was told that they were still working on seating reservations for 8pm,which was fine to us so we didn't mind sitting at the bar to wait a couple minutes while our table was being prepared.  At 8:48 we were never told that our table was ready and thought that the wait was starting to be excessive so I went to talk to the host to see if our table was ready yet and she started to give me an attitude, but eventually the manager came over and I explained the situation, which he understood and was very apologetic.  We were then seated and not greeted by our server with water for over 5 minutes.  Being as this was restaurant week we knew exactly what we wanted, but wanted to order a family order of calamari. The calamari took over 30 minutes to come out and it was dark brown, overly chewy, overcooked and cold.  We were going to settle with it, but after 2 pieces we couldn't eat out and respectfully returned it. They then brought out another batch about 5 minutes later that was night andv day different.  The calamari was very tasty and crunchy. Our new England clam chowder didn't come out until after 10pm, which was very good. Our entrees didn't come out until after 11pm and by that time we were not even hungry any more and just decided to ask for our desserts. We ate or desserts and asked for the rest of our meals to go and ran out of there around midnight very disappointed.  Probably will never come back to this establishment again.

I ordered the Greek quinoa salad and added salmon and it's some of the best salmon I've had in a very, very long time on any dish. As I expected, the portion sizes were on the smaller side but the quality was elevated. I began with the fennel & tomato soup which was a hot soup, on a summer day, but it was fantastic with deep flavor. 

I asked the server to bring the soup out first but, of course, it all came out at the same time. Not a huge ""thing"" but I think people are trying to work out kinks. The service was very friendly.

Our server had our drinks, our appetizers were great and then our burgers came and it was going well - until one of my friends found a large piece of plastic wrapper in her burger. Yikes!

Manager sees plastic, her first and only response- 'so, do you want us to make a new one or what?' as if it was our fault a piece of plastic was inside her burger. No apologies or even concern for my friend who could've just as well swallowed it. When she brought a new burger out, everyone had already finished their meals and my friend already lost her appetite, and this time, it was just a 'here's a new one, it's taken off the bill' and she walked away as soon as she placed it down. I don't know, maybe she was having a hard day, seeing how busy the restaurant was, but we will take a break from here for a bit.

There was a huge can fridge filled with Contemporary Centennial, a New England IPA that wasn't available on tap. They release their best beers in cans on (I believe the last was) Thursday. This makes it hard for anyone who lives far (like me) to access the cans. In the last ""can release"" they were only released in cans and not even on tap.

They are plenty friendly and smiley (the kiddo will bring that out in all but the most crotchety, haha) every time we have been.  Extra points for the cool t-shirts they wear, with the ""pho-getaboutit"" bit on the back.

And the food?  YUM.  We always get the grilled chicken vermicelli with egg rolls, and both are always delicious.  I like that they have a normal serving size option as well as the fit-for-giants portion as well.  The regular size is almost more than I can handle even when I'm absolutely famished walking through the door.  Everything is super-fresh, including the cilantro that I forget to ask them to leave out half the time.  And boy is there lots of it to pick out when you make THAT mistake.  The other veggies are sometimes on the slim side, but last time I went they were a lot more plentiful and much more what I am used to from other places.  I dig that you get to add your own amount of heat to the dressing, so I can pull some for the kiddo with minor spice and then add a bit more to mine.  The egg rolls are delicious, and the kiddo really digs the combination fried rice.  

Kind of irritating that they won't split a check, especially considering they have to ring everything by hand at the register where you pay... but I guess that's their prerogative, Bobby Brown.  It's definitely not going to keep me from coming back, and often.",POS

2151486,q8zJGr4jx6bGk7iNyHIi9g,3.0,"Went for lunch with a group from work around 1pm. The Brick House seems to portray itself as a slightly upscale American bar & grill. The simple exterior of the building doesn't give much of an indication of the inside, where the ambiance was actually pretty impressive. The restaurant has been converted from an old bank and features very high ceilings, several sub-sections besides the main dining area, and lots of interesting detailing still remaining from the bank. The dining area was very busy when we were there so it seems to be a popular lunch spot for local business-people.

The menu offers the typical variety of American cuisine: burgers, salads, some steak/chicken/seafood dishes. There are a few variations on some common food (buffalo shrimp, creole steak sandwich, fried Oreo sundae) but nothing that really stands out. 

Our group ordered a selection of appetizers, sandwiches, and salads. The kitchen seemed to be having some difficulty with timing during our lunch as the appetizers took much longer to arrive than anticipated. The server did notify us several instances of the wait and apologized so at least it wasn't a case of being ignored. For our main dishes, there were a variety of reactions: my Italian chicken sandwich was a bit cold with the chicken a bit dry but the flavors were good while another member raved about his Ahi tuna salad. Based on the food alone, I would personally say 2.5 stars. 

The service was very good; our server was prompt to offer refills, clear plates, and keeping us updated with the progress of our food order. And we were pleasantly surprised when they gave a discount for the extended wait without our even making a point of it (which is why I've skewed towards the 3 star rating instead of 2).

In general, our group was satisfied--but not thrilled--with the food and service during our experience at The Brick House. Don't expect anything spectacular from the cuisine, but downtown Pottstown is working to clean itself up the past few years and The Brick House definitely is a solid contribution to that. We will probably go back at some point and hopefully the kitchen will be having a better day next time.",NEU

I got the vegetarian version, which had peppers, snow peas, carrots (all fresh, mind you), egg, and that kind of dry, spiced tofu that's brown on the outside.  I love that stuff, but maybe not so much in pad thai.  Which, again, this wasn't.  The sauce was all wrong and the noodles were overcooked.  It was actually much like most of their other fried noodle dishes, which all taste mostly the same.  Disappointing.

But not surprising, given the middle-of-the-road kind of place this is.  I was more excited about it when it opened, simply because it was better than most places around, but, as I said before, that's not saying a whole lot.  So now that I'm less excited about it, I have to downgrade them.  Not much has changed.  The have a liquor license.  They started making dim sum on weekends, but why would anyone would go here rather than much better places in Chinatown or South Philly (Hi, Wokano!) is beyond me.

* Chair cushions were stained, windows were dirty from food splashing on them from the table, all the servers' uniforms (black slacks & black aprons) were covered in white lint. Not sure how everyone got the same lint on them. 

* Continued to overhear staff in the back corner of the restaurant laughing and cursing ABOUT THE RESTAURANT!!! We brought this to our waiter's attention and he gave us a black stare. This continued through the rest of our meal. 

* Husband ordered ice tea and when the waiter put down the small container of sugars, it was wet and the sugar packets had been splattered with food that was now caked on the paper. yuck! 

* Tuna Roll was mushy and a dreadful color. Tried one piece and sent it back. Unagi was simply wrong. Again, told the waiter and got a black stare. Requested a new waiter and manager. 

* Was given new waitress & told no manager was in. 

* Ordered the Thai Dish ~ Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken & Shrimp. Asked if it would be spicy, she said she could request the chef spice it up a bit. Got the dish and it looked like a pile of yellow baby food. No flavor, no distinguishable textures, overcooked chicken, old, reheated shrimp. Asked new waitress where the spice was? She got me a small bowl of chili oil and told me to us that to spice it up. 

* Went to the bathroom - it would have been a better choice to do my business outside in the bushes - that would have been more sanitary. Walked down a hallway and to the right was the kitchen with stacks and stacks of dirty dishes and then the bathroom ~ well, I held my breath the entire time I was in there.

55536,JsiLr_sVNx1qgOhuAspOKQ,4.0,"Where do I start?  

First of all, I suppose I should begin by saying ""shame on me"" for not trying this place sooner!  Mrs. S and I stopped in last Sunday with her parents in tow.  They were visiting and her father had always wanted to check out Old Town St. Charles, so we made our way down to Hendricks BBQ!

First off, if you aren't familiar with Old Town, parking is a bit of a mystery here.  You will need to look for a sign for public parking and go down the hill, and then make your way to the best spot you can find from there.  There is no place to park on the cobblestone street!

As far as food is concerned, there is plenty to choose from.  The in-laws mistakenly ordered family portions of green beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and sweet potato casserole with their Smoked Turkey dinners.  I say mistakenly because the waitress didn't do a very good job of explaining to them what they were ordering.  There was confusion over which meals came with sides, and which did not, and my mother in law talks more than she listens, so I cannot fault the waitress entirely!  

Mrs. S and I, on the other hand, ordered ""The Whole Shebang.""  It is exactly what it sounds like, a sample platter featuring each kind of meat they offer for BBQ.  There was a plentiful assortment of brisket, smoked turkey, ribs, sausage, and pulled pork.  The sauces were on the table, and each had their own appeal.  I enjoyed the combo of the honey bbq with the pulled pork, the dry sauce was great on the brisket, and the turkey went well with the house sauce.  My favorite was the sausage with their spiciest sauce.  

The meal also came with 4 sides, each much smaller than the family sized portions my in-laws were served!  Our selection was the sweet potato casserole, corn casserole, baked beans, and....Hell I can't remember!  I especially liked the baked beans and corn casserole, Mrs. S loved the sweet potato casserole.  We both ate the other side, whatever it was.  

The atmosphere here was really nice.  There was music playing but not overpowering, and honestly I really enjoyed it.  

My only complaints are with the service, and even these aren't beyond repair.  Initially, after being seated, it took several minutes to be acknowledged by a server.  For me this is a big deal, it sets the tone for the service, and it's the first thing I notice when dining out.  I will say, once our server, her name was Sarah, appeared, she did a decent job of keeping our glasses full and making sure we had everything we needed, although it seemed that the further into our meals we got, the longer we went between check ins.  Then, there was the issue with not taking the time to clarify the issues with the sides, which resulted in my in-laws ordering $22 worth of side items!  

The final complaint with service is the failure to at least ask if we were splitting the check.  This is another aggravation of mine, and maybe it is just me, but when two couples are sitting down for dinner, it seems like common sense to ask if the check needs to be split.  I don't carry cash on me, so it is always an inconvenience!  Just ask!

On a final note, I was pleased to see that Hendricks BBQ uses Yelp! Check-In discounts.  The $5 off our meal was a nice incentive. 

My closing thoughts on Hendricks BBQ are simple.  I loved the food.  The atmosphere is very inviting and I cannot wait to go back.  Today, I saw that Ian P. wrote an update on his review for Hendricks BBQ, where he mentioned that he is the Duke of this location.  I say, not for long Ian P.  Not for long indeed!",POS

I mean you cant beat $19 per night during the week. Well this weekend started out like the rest, Our room older but nice, very clean with a nice view of the Littlest Big City. 
Saturday came along, we went out for brunch (which was nice) and later returned to the Sands. We got into the elevator and started going up to our room. Then we reached the 8th floor and the elevator stopped, and the doors would not open. We waited a few minutes trying to get the doors open, and nothing. So we called security and told them we were stuck inside the elevator. The security  officer told us it would be an hour before  the elevator company would be there to let us out. We waited a little over and hour and we were free. 
Two security officers started questioning us, Asking what were did, We stated that we were bouncing around, kinda bubbly like, but not anything hardcore and the elevator just stopped running.  The security officer then told us, that we were jumping around inside of it like crazy people causing the elevator to think it was having an earthquake. I disagreed with the officer since we were not jumping around and with a load occupancy of 11 people or 2,500lbs how  could we have set off the sensors, He  then told us we would be responsible for the elevator tech to come out and it would cost us up to $1,500. I told the officer that we were NOT gonna pay for the tech to come out, because we were not horse playing (what the officer said later on). The officer then told us that if we didn't put our credit card info down on file that he was going to have us arrested for trespassing , Not wanting to go to jail, I gave him my info. He did assure me that there would be no charges until I authorize them. ( I wont be authorizing them). 
We finally made it to our room to relax a little before going to a show at the Silver Legacy. Still having questions I called down to talk to the front desk, of course the guy i talked to  (Orlando the front desk manager) wouldn't answer any of my questions, and told me he would have the Director of Security call me and he could answer my questions. The Director of Security never call me back. 
Later on we entered the elevator to leave for the night and  we noticed a new red sign on the elevator wall stating that if any horse play and or jumping inside the elevator will cause it to stall and the person would be responsible for the elevator company to come out. We took a pic of it laughing at it. We went to the other casino and enjoyed the show.
SUNDAY morning we went to check out and that was a breeze, We stopped by the security desk and asked how come the little red signs were not inside the elevator before our so call incident. The security manager on duty told us, that they have always been posted inside. I told him it was not true and showed him a pic I took of us inside the elevator when it go stuck, (no sign) The security manager quickly became very busy and told me he couldn't talk us and we would have to call on Tuesday to talk to the Director of Security?
So now its a waiting game to talk to the director of security

They first took over a buffet restuarant off of Bloomingdale that had been there for years.  The previous buffet was pretty good and had a local following.  Lee House went through a transition where they switched to being non-buffet and offering a traditional Chinese and Dim Sum menu, not just the American Chinese most of us are familiar with.  That's when my wife and I fell in love with the place.  Shortly after that, they closed down.

A few months later, they bought another buffet place on 60.  That buffet place had only been there a couple of years.  It started out really good and went down hill really fast.  I had stopped going there all together.  When Lee House took over, the first thing to go was the buffet.  It took them a couple of months to make the change over and they have worked hard to make the interior of the restaurant nicer......

That's not the reason to go though... The reason to go is the food.  It's amazing.  Everything is very fresh and very well traditional.  Their menu will seem huge, because the front half is traditional Chinese and the back half is American Chinese.

976647,4mj4FegTiagaeijLMLtXEg,1.0,"Went here for the first time this past Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. I was NOT impressed. I had called earlier in the week to make a reservation to find out they don't take them, but they do have call-ahead seating, which I thought was great. 

Fast forward to Saturday early evening. I called the restaurant at 6 (the earliest they accept calls for the call-ahead list), and was told there was going to be a 75 to 85 minute wait. I live a half hour away from the restaurant, so if we left at 630, we would only have to wait a few minutes and be seated pretty quickly. 

We get to the restaurant around 7 and check in at the hostess desk. We are given a buzzer and start to wait our turn to be seated.

Fast forward to it being 745, and we're still not seated, even after my bf has checked in once already with the hostess to see what our wait time would be. He was told when that we would only have 5 more minutes to wait to sit down.

It's now 815, and we're still not seated. My bf then checks in again and was told that the hostesses can no longer give him an estimated wait time ""due to how busy the restaurant is."" I'm getting cranky at this point since we are both starving, and if I don't eat, I get migraines, and I can feel one coming on.

We FINALLY get seated at 830, and I'm upset. I hoped that the food would be worth the wait since we waited a total of 2 1/2 hours, counting the call ahead time. NOT ACCEPTABLE. This restaurant has been open for quite some time, and glitches like that should have been worked out by this point. A party of 6 actually walked out while I was still waiting (which I was thinking about doing) and told the manager that they won't be coming back. 

The food was okay. The bread (which we had to ask for, which didn't make me happy) looked like a butt. It was good, but just good, not great. I had a salad and the ribs, and even though the ribs fell off the bone (as they should when they are cooked the right way) they just didn't taste worth the $26 they cost. My bf also had a salad and one of the steak dishes with grilled veggies, which I tasted and thought was bland. 

The service was just okay too, not great. I would've liked our server to recognize that my iced tea glass was empty and refilled it before I had to ask for more. Just a personal preference.

We went because he had received a $60 gift card for the holidays, otherwise I don't think I would've ever gone there. I am most certainly not going back any time soon. This restaurant just lost another potential few customers.",NEG
1892347,VygMseDHpzCuCritixdYPw,5.0,"I stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites New Orleans at the Convention Center this past weekend, 10/29/16 through 11/1/16, and received the most phenomenal service from the front desk staff upon arrival and also during our entire stay. 

We had purchased our hotel stay through a third party company, Hoteling.com, back in May of 2016. Upon arrival at the Hampton Inn we were notified that this company had filed for bankruptcy and closed their business back in July of 2016. We never received any notification that the company had closed or that our reservation was cancelled in result of this.  We had a confirmation number upon arrival and found out we did not have a reservation any more. 

The Front Desk Manager Michael immediately took over and assisted us in everyway that he could. It was an extremely busy weekend with two business conferences happening across the street, the Seahawks game, and it being Halloween weekend, the Hampton Inn was completely booked. Michael searched for availability and pricing at surrounding hotels. He found us a few options, but advised for us to utilized the Business Center on the second floor to continue the search. Michael gave us a card key to access this room to search for hotel availability for the weekend. Michael also offered to hold all of our luggage until we found somewhere to stay.

Online our options were very limited. Our only options near the French Quarter were extremely expensive and the only hotels with comparable pricing were our of town in Metairie or other Suburbs of NOLA. After about 20 to 30 minutes of searching Michael came upstairs to tell us that he just had someone cancel their reservation and that we were first in line to reserve it if we wanted. Of course we ran downstairs as fast as we could to reserve this open room. Michael was not only able to get us a room to stay, but he was able to offer it at an EXTREMELY gracious price. I won't say how much, but it was at the least $150 less than our options in the area. We did not complain or ask for a discount, he just simply offered a price out of the goodness of his heart.

The room we received only had a King Bed and a Pull-out for the four of us, but we were not in a position to complain at all. We actually joked that at this point we would have slept in the lobby.

However, the kindness of the staff did not end here. Michael was then able to offer our party a second room for the last two nights of our stay FREE of charge for the inconvenience. Even though the inconvenience was out of the Hampton's control entirely. That is customer service. My career is within the Travel Industry and this is an example of doing everything in their power to assist a guest in need. Even if Michael was not able to offer a room, how he handle the situation shows that the staff at this Hampton truly does care.  

If you are looking for a great place to stay with a staff that truly does care about it's guests, book the Hampton Inn & Suites near the Convention Center. It is located near the main highway for easy access to the airport, and walking distance from the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. The amenities and quality were also extremely nice. 10/10 will stay here each time I come back to NOLA. 

Thank you Hampton Inn!

The menu: I won't open the menu because I want to order everything inside of it! It all sounds good but so far the sushi is what I've gone for. They have a happy hour where sushi is HALF OFF. Also, if you miss happy hour, you get a discount (I believe 10%) for paying in cash! 

The sushi: I really like the salmon here. I'm not a fan of the yellowtail but my boyfriend thinks it's really good. I also think the tuna is really good even though I'm usually not a huge fan. Both the salmon and tuna nigiri were great! The salmon and spicy tuna rolls were also really good. I think my favorite thing here are the hand rolls. I've never seen sushi come like this before but I love it! Next time I'm going all hand rolls.

I've passed August Moon a few times and while the neighborhood might not be so great I actually prefer it that way. Some of the best food I've enjoyed has been in some run down neighborhood. The first thing I noticed was how bright and cheery the place is and there was nice melodic music playing softly. The bar tender and waitress were very welcoming as soon as I stepped through the door. I decided to sit at the bar because it looked comfortable and since I was alone I didn't feel the need to take up a table. I ordered a beer and the California Rolls to start. I enjoyed the California Rolls so much I decided to try something else on the menu. I ordered the Alaskan Tuna Roll and it was also very good. After the great experience with the sushi rolls I felt like I needed to try even more. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she directed me to the Bibim Bap (Mixed Rice) section. After reviewing carefully I choose the Seafood Stone Bowl it had rice, tons of vegetables, shrimp, squid, a huge mussel, and an enormous scallop. The bowl came out sizzling hot and it smelled amazing. I poured on the chili sauce that was served on the side and I mixed it all up. The smell emanating was delightful and as I mixed the dish together all the colorful vegetables came to the top. I thought this dish was excellent; it had a nice taste but was on the greasy side. While I don't typically like greasy foods this was an exception I had to make. Food aside I found both the waitress and the bar tender to be gracious, courteous, friendly, and helpful.

The silver lining is this is forcing me to stop being lazy and break out the smoker more often, so thanks for that :)

Of course Khyber pass Pub is now nothing like the ol' grimier days of fun live music times... 

It's still a good place for beers, I can tell you. Plenty of great craft beers are representing. And the food... I was surprised how good! I mean, I had definitely heard positive things. I had no, ""Well we'll just see about this,"" kind of attitude. I was just happily surprised.

For one thing, based on snacks alone you may find a face full of happiness in a bag of bacon grease popcorn. I ordered for the table. Bacony, spicy popcorn...It's real good, man.

 I probably would not have even thought to start with a bowl of Khyber's gumbo...until the words, ""Best Stop,"" caught my eye!  Their chicken and sausage gumbo featured Best Stop's andouille and it was just lip-smackin. After having spent some time all over Louisiana, I became well acquainted with Best Stop's amazing sausages...cracklins, boudin, tasso; it's pork heaven. Since Khyber provided me with some of their fine andouille sausage, I seized to opportunity to bore-ass everyone with my tales of culinary travels in Acadiana. What can I tell you? It's possible that I've never forgotten a meal. And I do so dig some Cajun and Creole flavors.

We spilt a fried oyster po boy and a roast beef po boy with debris gravy. The crispy fried gulf oysters were pretty wonderful but I damn did I enjoy that roast beef po boy. I wanted to steal that other half back greedily. It's a messy one- Comes dressed with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo and creole mustard; that juicy braised roast beef, is covered in good good gravy full of garlic and all that beefy pan-juicy goodness and tasty bits. I'll be thinkin bout you, sandwich. 

Despite all my swoony speak over meats and gravies, I'll add that there are really a good amount of vegetarian and vegan options available as well. Another plus- I do believe that they serve food til 1 AM...for saaay, if you have a hankerin for some good fries covered in debris gravy and smoked cheddar. Wowww good cheese fries, shake a little hot sauce, you're livin...

 I'm extra excited about returning to sample more of Khyber Pass' cajun cookin now that we had this good lil experience.

We're at the old Khyber? We're eatin gumbo and po boys in Philly?  Yup, totally happily surprised.",POS

723080,tPPYvOGfEqmdpGbzNBjnCQ,3.0,"I love the dark quiet retreat that is the Woodhouse Spa. I also love the fact that they are only a spa - in other words, no hair services here. This is why Woodhouse is so quiet and inviting, in my humble opinion. That, and the interior looks more like somebody's vacation villa than a spa.

My first visit here found me indulging in the signature Woodhouse manicure. Debbie was my therapist and did a great job of making my terribly neglected paws looking smashing. The only two things that were disappointing was arriving to find out that the person with whom I made my appointment had put me down for a pedicure - quickly remedied on arrival. And, I would have liked to be reminded that the ""Frosty French"" polish I received would run an additional $5. It wasn't that I minded paying for this, I just think it's best to check with the client first. 

Now the good stuff: the quiet room where you wait for your therapist is dimly lit, smells great and helps you begin to make the transition from harried worker bee to about-to-be-pampered goddess. The staff settles you in and offers robe, slippers and a choice of several beverages - very nice. Also, my manicure was done in a very private room with a nice massage chair. My feet were soaking away in the foot spa, the kinks were being worked out of my back and an aromatherapy ""neck buddy"" was keeping me nice and cozy while Debbie did her best to transform my nails. The end result was wonderful and I definitely felt better all over after my appointment. 

I never felt rushed here, which was great. The spa also appears to have a nice line of skin care products  - proprietary and essential oil based - along with a small selection of candles, fragrance and mineral cosmetics. 

I am giving 3-stars here now so that I can return for one of Woodhouse's other signature treatments and do a review update. They offer some interesting ""east meets west"" therapies here that I must try! I'm sure that any of these will result in an ""upgrade"" of 4 or 5 stars.",NEU

There is a shortage of vets in Tucson that are able to help with weekend emergencies, this was the 15th clinic I called and they got him in on a Friday night and quickly had him on a road to recovery. I entirely trust Civano Animal Hospital and would 100% recommend it for an emergency and wouldn't hesitate to have them as a primary care provider.

Less important... but this is a beautiful facility, out of the way for much of Tucson, but it is worth the drive. I am so grateful my dog is recovering and back to his usual self!

I can't stress this enough... GET PET INSURANCE while your pet is healthy and doesn't need it. Having pet insurance gives you confidence without worry that you won't have to make any compromises (because of $$$) to receive the best testing/care... this gives the doctors the best data to work with and creates less guesswork for them. This usually means your pet will get better faster and your wallet will thank you--this was definitely the case for us!

Can't thank you enough, Civano staff, Dr. A and Dr. M.

1006913,_Zjp2CRdbdaV8rtxYMxS2w,2.0,"My Mom had brought to my attention the opening of this place, with it's description as a ""Sushi Buffet"". I'm a pretty big sushi lover, so I was excited about the prospect of unlimited rolls inside my stomach. Now, my mother is not the director of marketing for Ichiban inc, so I was not totally outraged walking in: I stopped at the front counter and looked around...where is the sushi? All I could see was steaming counters of cooked, fried looking things. I figured it was somewhere around there...
       We took a seat and received drinks from a very sweet asian woman (All of the staff is very nice). I got up to get my food, and figured out where the sushi was. A small area with about a dozen or so rolls displayed for the taking. There were a couple of identifiable rolls, most of them were these saucy extravagant things. Most are cooked. I went with the salmon and tuna nigiri (raw fish laid on top of rice) as well as an eel roll and shrimp tempura (both cooked). Honestly, not terrible. Besides the strange taste of the tuna, everything was very typical mediocre sushi. 
        For my second plate I decided to try some of the other offerings, which comprise of 80% of the food offered. Most of it consists of fried seafood, fried chinese dishes (lo mein, dumplings), some random american things and pizza (wtf). And yes, there is a desert area with a chocolate fountain and some custardy ice cream. I tried bits and pieces, all of it was not terrible (All of the shrimp offerings were pretty good). 
        So why two stars? Well, in typical buffet style, everything is edible but nothing is really very tasty. The only caveat with this place is the sushi offerings, which are mediocre as well. However, the real reason this place gets a low mark from me is the horrible SMELL and atmosphere inside. I don't know what combination of things it was, but it smelled like a fishy bathroom in there. It really turned my stomach and affected my whole experience. The other problem is the depressing interior. There was no music playing, just Delco's finest eating in silence under dim lighting. Occasionally a baby would scream and add to the creepy vibe. Incredibly suicide inducing. 
        If you want unlimited sushi, try two local spots: The basement of Hibachi in Springfield is incredibly fresh and spot on. Minado in Blue Bell is also awesome if you're in that area (and all around the same price). If you're actively seeking out a Home Country Buffet replacement I guess this will do the trick for you, however due to my reasons above I will not be returning here.",NEG

6029198,uiSmpfzYW1oBaMUOmXC_CQ,5.0,"Coppertown is nothing less than amazing and definitely a positive start to my weekday mornings! 

I work in the city and take SEPTA to get there. My mornings are early and my days are long and I hate making my own cup of joe in the morning, because it's ""never as good as having someone else brew it for you"". 

Sure, there's every local's favorite convenience store less than a mile away, or the large national corporate coffee stores, but why not support a local, privately owned business where the drinks the staff and the service is always consistent? 

Coppertown has become a staple in my weekday morning routine that I stumbled upon by happenstance. There's another local coffee shop within two blocks of Coppertown, that I got tired of for several reasons: 1. there's no drive thru; 2. the ""early morning staff"" and service seems a bit ""ritzy"" for Downingtown, but nonetheless, subpar; 3. the menu seems a bit steep and the items seem mediocre for the price; 4. it doesn't open until until 7:00AM Mon-Sat & 8:00AM on Sun ().. I could continue, but this review isn't about them, it's about Coppertown!

After deciding I was sick of waiting for the other local shop to open every morning, I decided to try that cute little drive thru coffee spot that I always passed but never found time to stop for.

When I pulled up to the window, a smiling woman who I assumed was the owner welcomed me and took my order. My first drink at Coppertown was a latte and I found it to be a thumbs up latte - made quick and with quality. I returned the next morning for another latte with hopes that it would be just as good as the day prior. 

Upon pulling up to the window, Joan again welcomed me and took my order. As she was making my latte, I didn't hesitate to tell her that the latte was one of the best lattes I've had in a long time and I couldn't wait to stop again. Joan turned towards me and smiled, thanked me and it was very evident that the gratitude she had for my business was reciprocal to the gratitude I had for the prior day's latte. After my second visit to Coppertown and my second latte (which was just as delicious as my first), I knew that I found my new favorite local coffee shop! 

Not only did Joan and the girls memorize my order by week two, but every morning my order is always started before even arriving at the window. While I may not enjoy how early my weekday mornings begin, they sure are a lot more pleasant when they begin with Coppertown! 

While I love that the drinks, the staff and the service is always consistent, my favorite thing about Coppertown is knowing that I am supporting a local, privately owned coffee shop over a national corporate coffee chain, and the passion that Joan has is evidently brewed into every pot!

The Jordan's Sweet And Smokey BBQ Burger was easily one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Full of great flavor, with a seasoned beef patty, super tasty bacon, and toppings that you can customize to your heart's content. Their homemade BBQ sauce is smokey and flavorful. The burger was super messy in the best way possible, full of flavor, and just excellent.

The hand-cut fries were cooked to perfection, and they are wildly generous with the fries. When I watched them prepare our order I laughed out loud when I saw how many fries they put with my burger. I mean, I have an appetite, but I couldn't finish all of the fries! So now I have a bonus snack for tomorrow.

The chili is very good, with quite a bit of kick. If you don't like spicy food you'll want to skip the chili.

I'll admit that we ordered our burgers medium, and they were cooked to medium well. But let's be honest, pretty much every burger place tends to cook a bit beyond medium. And everything was so full of flavor that I didn't mind looking past the patty being a little over-cooked.

I have now been visiting this restaurant for around 2+ years now and it's my go to more often than any other restaurant in the area. I love the servers, I could go through them by name and the food is delicious and one of the general manager is lovely and attentive to her customers. She will routinely check in with guests to make sure that they are enjoying their experience and the food. 

The food is consistently cooked to perfection. There seems to be one particular chef, who when on duty just seems to be creating magic back in the kitchen. I wish I knew his name so that I could give him the props that he deserves. 

We've many time now been able to walk into the restaurant they know how we like to order our food, which I really love. 

Their new dinner service is also very good. I like that it's almost like being in two separate restaurants. They close their doors for almost 2.5 hours for prep time and I like that a restaurant has the ability to change themselves in such a small, yet significant way. 

As a side not; Isaiah is a personal favorite server of mine and the minute I see he is there, I instantly seek out his table. He is funny and man, he is great at his job.

I will always recommend this place to anyone who asks. 

....oh, and try the ranch!!

The fries were pretty good but the portion they gave was slightly larger than a kids meal. For the bolognese, I've never had a pasta dish this expensive without it being a homemade pasta with veal or seafood. The taste was okay but again overall pretty bland.

3140601,cUYzxrYsCwLF0kiittcxrg,3.0,"I really wavered between 2.5 and 3 stars on Campo so let me state that I liked it but there is a lot of room for improvement.

To start the hostess was fine but where she sat us I could literally not get my legs under the table.  We immediately asked the hostess for a new seat.  She said that it would be a few minute wait, no problem.  We started noticing that there were a lot of two tops available but we weren't called.  I didn't question it yet.  After 30 minutes I got up and asked how my table was coming along to the hostess.  She greeted me as if she completely forgot who I was (which she had).  If I hadn't asked we would still be sitting at the bar.  She grabbed two menus and immediately took off for the table.  We hadn't closed out at the bar yet so I had to almost chase down the hostess to find our seat and then go back to the bar to close out and grab my fiancee.  I'm sure this is just a hiccup but an annoyance.

We were seated at a nice table and ordered a nice bottle of wine.  However, their are no traditional wine glasses at Campo, instead they serve everything in a tumbler.  To me this is a big issue, if this was table wine I could understand it but it was a pretty decent bottle and looking around the dining room there did not appear to be any wine glasses and I didn't notice any at the bar.

We proceeded to order the salumi plate which was really fantastic.  We each then ordered a bowl of pasta.  This has been touched on previously but the prices are ridiculous for the portion size.  The quality was great but $17 for a bowl of rigatoni is ludicrous.  These are San Francisco prices and this is by far not a San Francisco quality restaurant, yet.  For a comparison of prices, Bacco in SF charges $17 for a bowl of rigatoni, and Delfina charges $17 for a bowl of pappardelle.  Needless to say the prices at Campo are outrageous for the area.

The atmosphere is friendly and warm but it seems that it doesn't know if it wants to be a casual restaurant or a more upscale restaurant.  All of the servers wore dark jeans and black tops and the tables are bare except for a napkin and utensils.  But at the same time they charge sky-high prices which are more appropriate for San Francisco than Reno.

We also felt a little rushed in selecting our entrees and wine selection because we felt that we wouldn't be able to get the server's attention again.  This is an issue that I certainly hope will be worked out quickly but in actuality should have been handled before Campo ever opened their doors.

I sincerely hope that Campo does well downtown because the area is missing anything really fantastic but there are areas that need definite improvement.

I'll come back in a month or two to see how, or if, Campo has improved but for right now it is at best a three star establishment.",NEU

The restaurant keeps the lights pretty low, so it is a bit hard to see the menu before your eyes are fully adjusted.  They try to push bottled water (Fiji, etc) on you, but just say no thanks, I'll take normal water and they won't hesitate.

I would recommend this place to anyone.  On a Saturday at 7 pm, the place had about every person type in it.  Upscale to kids finishing dinners and moving out, and us, somwhere in between.  The dress states ""business casual"", but you can get away with some nice jeans and a button-up shirt.

The owners don't really post a weekly schedule like some trucks do, but rather post where they'd be when they park. They seem to not serve on Sundays and Mondays. Other days are more predictable, but never a guarantee.

The sandwich was very large and just looked amazing. I grabbed the sandwich and just felt the crispiness of the chicken through the soft bun. I thought to myself, ""This sandwich is LEGIT."" The sandwich itself packed a good bit of heat, but I feel like that was the only thing that was focused on. I thought it needed some more seasoning to be more enjoyable. The Special was just a little sweeter and less spicy than the T.N. Hot. The Southern was surprisingly my favorite of the three I tried! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness for a fried chicken sandwich and was enjoyable for every bite. I also added fries to one order for only $1 and it was a good bit of fries.

After reviewing the menu and also taking the waiter's recommendations we choose the shrimp and scallops with risotto and the crab cakes. Neither dish was remarkable. The shrimp had a pungent smell/ similar to when they are not deveined well though I could see no evidence of that beyond the grill markings. The scallops were bitter and nothing on the dish was seasoned properly. The risotto was piecy, lacked seasoning, and did not have any truffle flavor. It was a little unappetizing to see a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish as well. Moving on to the crab cakes, I'm thinking we ordered the wrong dish. Crab cakes were soggy (even before the sauce) and had a good amount of filler vs crab. There were at least 8 separate pieces of crab shell that disturbed the chewing experience.  I find that the ingredients are high quality but the execution was flawed. The meal left is a scratching our heads.

I was afraid I wouldn't make it to the bakery to pick up the items due to the chaos of so many people checking in.

This place smelled amazing and they had several gluten-free items. The staff was very understanding when they called and I was running late. Very friendly and personable. 
At the signing, people went crazy over the treats. I had a pistachio cannoli, and it was one of the best treats I ever had. Coconut macaroons can sometimes be dry, but these were unbelievably moist and delicious. People raved over them and asked where the bakery was located.

Awesome food (no, really, you'd never know this deliciousness was being served at a dive bar!) at great prices, especially at their various ""nights"" like Burger Night, Taco Tuesday, etc.

I'm a frequent customer of the vintage, I literally love coming here, getting work done and just the overall vibe.

I was ignored by a waitress. I walked to the bar, she was involved in a conversation with other customers, once she was done she walked past me and said nothing. She proceeded to the kitchen and joked around with the cook avoided making eye contact with me. 

I am African American btw, a white couple entered and were serviced by someone else. The waitress can't from the back, acknowledged me but then went on doing something else. 

I sat down because she seemed very busy. I waited until I saw her at the bar, I jokingly said, hey, are you clear or should I come back. She immediately became defensive and said, well I'm the only one working and I'm very busy but I can fix your drink now.

She said it very loud with a very sharp tone in front of the other patrons. I've never felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable in her. I proceeded to just not order.

After reading positive reviews ad infinitum about the beer can chicken sandwich, I decided that this thing was going to blow apart my expectations of what a chicken sandwich could do.  My expectations were let down.

Their mussels and fries are decent, but don't stack up to Monk's.

I appreciate the constantly rotating beer selection but it wasn't enough to salvage the food.  If you are going to market yourself as a gastropub(I think I hate this term), then your food should rock as much as your beer does.  In my opinion, this is not the case with Kraftwork.",NEU

I was in and done in 20 minutes. It is a repurposed water treatment plant so these animals are in repurposed silos, they... Show Dolphins who were hurt in the wild in shows out of a 15'wide 30'deep circular tube. (It is my understanding the shows may have since been cancelled although that may just be the opportunity to swim with the Dolphins)

I am happy to donate, I volunteer for shelters adopted 3 abandoned pets etc. LOVE animals. But truthfully I felt like I was being shown crippled broken animals, (that the crew here work wonderfully to rehab) but being told it's an aquarium... 

They are upgrading over the next few years to a massive facility in downtown Clearwater hopefully it evolves into a full fledged animal rehab AND aquarium. In the interim I paid a ton of money for a guilt complex and misrepresented impression of what the facility was. If they said marine sanctuary I would have felt better about spending the money. 

I just went in with the wrong idea of what to expect as it's always represented as Clearwater aquarium.

When you arrived they took your temperature and was supplied hand sanitizer. Each station is barricaded by plastic dividers for both the patron and nail side. It was very clean and not very busy. I was provided a booklet of colors to choose for my gel manicure. At the end, they offer several options for lotion aromas which was nice to be able to choice. Although I got a single color, those near me has awesome artwork done. I would recommend heading to Kiora if you need your nails done. I'll definitely be back",POS
666395,oL39W38hmHrt6iT04qsQpw,1.0,Stay away!  False advertising!  Website clearly states they will attic inspections but when you need them too they say they don't go into attics!  They will tell 'other locations may go into attics but not my guys'.  Website goes into great detail about health and home risks of having rodents in your home but they won't do a damn thing about it when you actually get one.  Had to pay to break our contract early even though they broke it by lying.   Worth every penny!  Have a new company coming tomorrow more than willing to help us!,NEG

Typical south tampa crowd, nice blend of peeps. 
Menu was pretty basic. Few selections of hamburgers and dogs. You can create your own which was cool.  You can get your fries with different types of seasoning, which is a plus.  Burgers are rather small for 6-7 dollars, but good. I think me and my girl paid somewhere around 20 for 2 burgers and a large fries.  Will definitely be back when we're in the mood for burger!",POS

I am not one to write reviews especially negative ones but this was probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. I ordered through the app which was very easy to navigate. The food was expensive but I figured it would be worth the hype so I ordered a bit of everything. I was hosting some family and I was treating them to dinner so we ordered the chicken nuggets, two different burgers, cheese fries, and 3 different shakes. The app told me my food was done at 7:28 I walk up at 7:30 there's a line outside the building so I go in looking for an employee to help me there's one girl standing in the front not directing anyone or helping people navigate their orders or anything... simply just standing there in the middle of absolute chaos. I understand that this restaurant is new but I could just tell how poor the management was, the back where the kitchen was looked completely hectic people were running into each other people were messing up orders taking stuff off of trays and then I noticed that they were pre-making drinks and shakes which to me is kind of odd because they just sit there and melt until someone orders them. I stepped on a catch-up package while I was in there and it squirted all over my leg and all over the floor and I got napkins and cleaned it all up. There was a pile of ketchup packages that fell on the floor and none of the employees had bothered to pick them up so I did. The store overall didn't seem all that clean which is crazy because it's fairly new.It was all just a mess. lines and waits are expected but this was just a huge mess. So I go in and I finally get an employee to help me and ask them about my order, they told me they were having issues with the cheese machine and they were waiting on my cheese fries. So I go stand off in a corner and wait patiently, it's now 7:50 and everyone else behind me has gotten their order and I'm still waiting... not to mention I was in a time crunch and had plans, thus the reason we order ahead via the app for take out... so I was just standing there waiting for our food that was supposed to be done at 7:28. finally At almost 8 o'clock I get my order And My shakes were all melted, the fries were cold, The chicken nuggets were dried out and cold, The burgers are the only thing that were half way decent. In all honesty for the cost of the food I was very disappointed in the quality and taste Especially with Portillo's right down the road, I rather take my money there it is always fresh and absolutely delicious no matter what I order. I'm super disappointed And never plan on going in again... If there is one positive thing I can say is that the man who was tending to the orders was very kind. Even though it was very hectic I could tell he was trying and 1 appreciate that.",NEG

666164,IY8LDlb_Y5ewGuawXGb5ig,2.0,"Glad to see something else open in this building/location, but I was less than impressed when I came here for brunch.

We had a large party (16 i think?) and only one server taking care of all of us- most of who were also drinking. Understandably, service was slow. We were there celebrating a friend's birthday- and due to her diet which limits sugar, she asked if she could do bottomless mimosas but without the orange juice, and the request was declined. 

The prices were inflated for the type of food (and beers were $10), which is almost to be expected due to the location.  Food was good, but nothing spectacular that we couldn't get somewhere else for half the price. 

American Social is the kind of place I expect to see in Ft Lauderdale or Miami. And for those who enjoy that scene, are probably very happy to see something like this in Tampa now. But, I do not plan on returning.",NEG

They did an amazing job with him but Thor started to decline quickly as he was in liver failure. We wanted him to have 24/7 care and even though we knew he was dying, we wanted to give him every chance possible. We took him to CARE as we heard great things about one internal medicine doctor however, she was unavailable so we saw an ER doctor. She explained that we could provide him with plasma to help with the clotting and some other medication that we eventually determine would only pronounce the inevitable. We wanted to see our baby boy to speak with him and make a decision but had to in the parking lot in front of everyone waiting in their cars. We decided to put our baby to sleep as he was in so much pain. We were then bought into the lobby for the doctor to perform the euthanization. We waited almost 30 minutes for my dog to be put to sleep. Not only did we wait but my baby boy was howling for 20 minutes in severe pain. We had to knock on the door four times to get them to come out.y husband and I understand our boy was not the only sick patient but I will forever have nightmares of my boy howling in pain before we put him to sleep. The doctor came out, did not walk us through anything, and just gave him the medication to put him to sleep. No empathy or I'm sorry whatsoever! Not only that but to make matters worse she did not prepare us for the bucket of blood he expelled on our feet after he passed. I will never ever take my beloved fur babies here again and I'm distraught that my baby boys passing was not peaceful but instead excruciating for him and us.",NEG
